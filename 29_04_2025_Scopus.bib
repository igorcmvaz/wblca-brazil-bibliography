	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to examine the economic and social factors that influence individual savings in Brazil based on the life cycle hypothesis (LCH). Design/methodology/approach: The authors use data sourced from 2017 to 2018 Household Budget Surveys to analyse the individual savings of Brazilian aged from 18 to 80. Findings: Using a conventional logistic regression model, results of this study suggest that several demographic characteristics, such as education, economic and social factors, influence individual savings in Brazil. For instance, this paper finds a non-linear relationship between age and individual savings, following LCH concepts. Originality value: These data provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate the determinants of individual savings in Brazil. In examining this question, this study contributes to the literature by providing new evidence to help the current political debate about the Brazilian social security system. Against this background, social policies should be designed to promote savings, especially in groups with a lower likelihood of savings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the challenges and political implications of sustainable maintenance in residential condominiums in Brazil from the perspective of the building life cycle. The research adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. Structured questionnaires were administered to 94 participants, selected based on accessibility and interest in the topic, along with participant observation in a condominium certified by the AQUA-HQE™ Process and document analysis. Statistical analysis included descriptive measures, Bartlett's test of sphericity, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index, which, together with exploratory factor analysis, identified five factors that explain 45.2 % of the total variance in the data, highlighting the relevance of key variables related to perceptions of sustainability, incentives, and challenges in maintenance. The results reveal a low awareness among owners' residents about the importance of sustainable maintenance, difficulties in the transfer of information between construction companies and managers, and the insufficiency of effective public incentives. Thus, the study highlights a gap in the integrated application of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment in the construction sector, suggesting the need to develop more robust public policies and establish quantitative indicators to measure the economic and environmental benefits of these practices. In summary, the findings contribute to understanding the barriers and opportunities in promoting sustainable practices in buildings, emphasizing the importance of interventions that articulate technical, economic, and social aspects to enhance condominium management and foster more sustainable urban development. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to provide an LCA of raw cow milk production systems from the two most representative states (Paraná and Minas Gerais) for milk production in Brazil considering four impact categories according to product category rules of raw milk; and (ii) to analyze the environmental performance of milk produced in Brazil (at the farm-gate) with that of milk produced in other parts of the world (at the farm-gate) based on valid EPDs of processed whole milk and LCA studies of milk in the existing literature. For building life cycle inventories, agricultural processes and activities associated with milk production were mapped out. Three milk production systems in Brazil were assessed, one confined, and two semi-confined, in two different regions, within Minas Gerais and Paraná states. The functional unit used in this study was 1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk. Moreover, an analysis of the environmental performance of milk produced in Brazil with that of milk produced in other parts of the world based on valid EPDs of processed milk was made. LCA results and the results obtained from the valid EPDs used different life cycle impact assessment methods (IPCC 2013; CML, ReCiPE) and impact categories (climate change, acidification potential, eutrophication, formation potential of tropospheric ozone). The raw milk (cradle-to-farm-gate) produced in Brazil (in different states and based on different systems - confined or semi-confined) has lower environmental impacts when associated with those (cradle-to-farm-gate) of published EPDs. The study also briefly compared the results of Brazilian milk production systems with cradle-to-farm-gate LCAs of raw milk found in the literature, and discussed a few strategies for the Brazilian market of milk and dairy products. MPS in Brazil can serve as a benchmark for MPS in other countries, and EPDs can add transparency to business-to-business and business-to-consumer relations. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Considerable progress in our understanding of long-distance migration has been achieved thanks to the use of small geolocator devices (GLS). The tracking of resident or short-distance migrant animals remains however challenging because geolocation errors are substantial and difficult to estimate. This study aims to examine the sex-specific marine space uses of a resident tropical seabird, the masked booby (Sula dactylatra), during its full annual life cycle at the Fernando de Noronha archipelago (Brazil). Masked boobies (n = 31) tagged with GLS recording light intensity, seawater immersion, and water temperature showed a resident behaviour over their entire annual cycle. A wavelet analysis of GLS data revealed oscillatory patterns of inferred longitude correlated with changes in immersion frequency. This synchronicity demonstrated that birds traveled away and back from the colony on consecutive trips of short length (∼ 2–4 days) and short range (∼ 100–300 km) eastward of the colony. Duration and range of trips depended on the sex of the individual and on the time of the year. Trip duration increased gradually from the end of the breeding period to the post-breeding period, probably due to the release of the central-place breeding constraints. During the pre-breeding period, females had farther ranges eastward and spent more time in water than males. Despite inherent limits of light-based geolocation, this study demonstrates the relevance of synchronicity analysis of GLS data for investigating year-round movements of resident or short-distance migrants. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In Brazil, there are densely populated metropolitan regions, motivated by a great migratory flux in the 1970s. One of the consequences is the increased per capita municipal solid waste generation, which has been constantly associated with deficient waste management. That is the case of 19 municipalities from Goiás State that inappropriately disposed of 73% of the produced household waste. According to Law No. 12,305/2010, these municipalities must implement a waste management facility with MSW recovery and landfill diversions to minimize environmental impacts. Furthermore, a specific life cycle assessment tool was used to conduct an environmental assessment of different alternatives for a shared waste management system among the metropolitan municipalities. The results have shown that the current scenario has the largest environmental impacts in seven of 12 assessed impact categories, among them the global warming potential. In this scenario, final waste disposal has the greatest environmental impact, particularly due to unlicensed landfills. Conversely, anaerobic digestion with greater landfill diversions generates the lowest emissions in eight of 12 impact categories. This demonstrates the importance of anaerobic digestion and the compliance of the diversion targets established by the Brazilian National Plan for Solid Waste Management. © 2022 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

	abstract = {We investigate how Amazonian smallholders' land use systems coevolve with household-level demographic factors associated with changing livelihood strategies over the different stages of frontier development. Few micro-level studies have investigated this association, particularly due to the paucity of longitudinal data on cohorts of farm colonist households and plots. Cohort analysis is the only way to depict how the structural conditions affecting individual and household livelihood decisions differ from earlier to later stages of frontier development. Our methodological approach involves a unique dataset, based on a micro-level panel of farm households depicting 25 years of settlement in the municipality of Machadinho, in the Brazilian Amazon. We use descriptive statistics with paired t-tests, land use classification analysis, latent transition analysis, and longitudinal multinomial regressions to understand which cohorts of households thrived or failed and, most importantly, why and when. Splitting the data into panels of settlement cohorts helped us understand the effect of demographic life cycle markers on land use choices over the different stages of frontier development and the ability of farm households to adapt their livelihoods at the frontier over time. We found that, as the colonization frontier integrated into markets, the most successful original settlers were those who diversified their portfolio of capitals and livelihood strategies as a response to new local and regional market conditions. We also found a progressive change from land use systems based on subsistence agriculture to diversified land use systems that combine on- and off-farm activities. Livelihood diversification is key to preventing households from becoming trapped in a long-term deprivation trajectory, particularly when the frontier becomes more urban and market-oriented. This explains why land use has become progressively independent of household demographic dynamics in advanced stages. We contend that, as frontiers integrate into markets, diversification should not only be incentivized, but should also be used as a technical strategy to enhance access to subsidized rural credit, as it seems to increase farmers’ likelihood to thrive and improve their resilience against shocks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study focuses on a typical Brazilian household through the lens of sustainable development, regarding energy demand and GHG emissions. The analysis encompasses both the direct and indirect energy, exergy consumption, and GHG emissions (quantified by life cycle assessment) associated with the usual routine of a household. The household is modeled as a thermodynamic system to evaluate inputs (food, electricity, fuels for transportation) and outputs (solid and liquid residues). The hypothesis is that each input and output contains CO (Formula presented.) emissions and exergy derived from its physical-chemical characteristics or production chains. Each household appliance is modeled and tested as a function of external parameters. The contribution of several industries was obtained to the total GHG emissions and exergy flows entering and exiting the household (e.g., fuels for transportation, food, gas, electricity, wastewater treatment, solid waste). It was verified that urban transportation was the flow with the highest GHG and exergy intensity, ranging between 1.49 and 7.53 kgCO (Formula presented.) /day and achieving 94.7 MJ/day, almost five times higher than the calculated exergy demand due to electricity. The second largest flow in GHG emissions was food due to the characteristics of the production chains, ranging from 1.6 to 4.75 kgCO (Formula presented.) /day, depending on the adopted diet. On the other hand, the electricity presented low GHG emissions due to the main energy sources used to generate electricity, only 0.52 kgCO (Formula presented.) /day. Moreover, the chemical exergy of the solid waste was 9.7 MJ/day, and is not irrelevant compared to the other flows, representing an interesting improvement opportunity as it is entirely wasted in the baseline scenario. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a neglected tropical disease with life-threatening implications. In this study, we conducted a seroepidemiological survey to determine the prevalence and clinical profiles of CD in 217 individuals from an impoverished rural community in Southern Bahia, Brazil. The overall prevalence of CD in the studied community was 0.92%, detected through latent class analysis (LCA). Two individuals tested positive for anti-T. cruzi IgG, both being male farmers. One case was a 22-year-old man born in Camamu, with no evidence of congenital transmission, suggesting other routes of transmission such as vector-borne transmission due to migratory activities. The other case was a 69-year-old man born in São Felipe, who had lived in an adobe/brick house and had a pacemaker due to cardiac involvement caused by CD. The prevalence in this community was lower than expected, given the socioeconomic conditions and environmental factors that contribute to T. cruzi transmission. This could be attributed to the implementation of preventive measures and vector control programs by the Brazilian Government. However, continuous monitoring and surveillance are essential to sustain control efforts and detect any potential re-emergence of the disease. While the overall prevalence was low, the detection of positive cases underscores the need for continued surveillance and control measures in vulnerable populations, such as rural communities. Active surveillance, early diagnosis, and timely treatment are crucial in preventing disease progression and complications, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of screening and treatment programs. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) have been defined to promote the workplace participation of undergraduate medical students, generally in the context of high-income countries with a focus on the secondary and tertiary health care sectors. These EPAs have limited applicability to training and health care contexts in low- to middle-income countries that have a focus on primary health care, for instance, the context of community medicine. The purpose of this article is to report the process and results of defining EPAs for undergraduate medical training in a community health care setting. Methods: A modified Delphi study was performed to develop EPAs for the training of medical students in community medicine during their first and second years of education at the Marília Medical School (FAMEMA), Brazil. The supervision level was operationalized in terms of a student’s ability to perform the EPA autonomously in an effective and safe manner with supervision readily available on request. Panellists (9 physicians and 6 nurses) rated the completeness of the proposed list of EPAs and EPA categories on four-point Likert scales. The threshold for consensus among panellists was a mean content validity index of at least 80%. Results: Consensus was reached after two Delphi rounds, resulting in 11 EPAs for undergraduate medical education and training in community medicine. These EPAs were organized into three overarching EPA domains: integrality of care for individual health needs in all phases of the life cycle (5 EPAs), integrality of care for family health needs (3 EPAs), and integrality of care for community health needs (3 EPAs). For each EPA, descriptions of the following categories were created: title; specifications and limitations; conditions and implications of the entrustment decision; knowledge, skills, and attitudes; links to competencies; and assessment sources. Conclusion: The resulting 11 EPAs for training medical students in community medicine expand the application of the EPA framework to both early undergraduate medical education and the context of primary health care. This report can support and guide other medical schools in their attempts to train students in primary health care contexts and to incorporate EPAs into their curricula. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Coatings play a fundamental role in the exterior wall system of a building and are directly related to its performance through life. Increased durability and lifespan can be achieved when coating’s integrity can prevent the entrance of aggressive agents on the substrate. Therefore, the condition of this system should be periodically evaluated, considering not only technical and economic aspects in the selection of the materials for repair, but also sustainability aspects, in order to reduce the environmental impacts incorporated into the building. In this study, a Brazilian building dated from 1908 was evaluated with the purpose of detecting pathological manifestations in its outer coating. In a primarily inspection stage, cracks and coating detachments were identified as the pathological manifestations with higher incidence in the evaluated facades. Three maintenance strategies were assessed for crack repair and two for the purpose of resolving the loss of adhesion. Subsequently, a life cycle analysis (LCA) was performed for each intervention alternative. Results indicate that regarding the cracks correction, the solution that presented the lowest environmental impact potential was the model that uses lime paste for filling, while for detachments the indicated solution from an environmental point of view is the polymer-free model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The building sector is one of the most relevant sectors in terms of environmental impact. Different functional units (FUs) can be used in life cycle assessment (LCA) studies for a variety of purposes. This paper aimed to present different FUs used in the LCA of buildings and evaluate the influence of FU choice and setting in comparative studies. Methods: As an example, we compared the “cradle to grave” environmental performance of four typical Brazilian residential buildings with different construction typologies, i.e., multi-dwelling and single dwelling, each with high and basic standards. We chose three types of FU for comparison: a dwelling with defined lifetime and occupancy parameters, an area of 1 m2 of dwelling over a year period, and the accommodation of an occupant person of the dwelling over a day. Results and discussion: The FU choice was found to bias the results considerably. As expected, the largest global warming indicator (GWi) values per dwelling unit and occupant were identified for the high standard dwellings. However, when measured per square meter, lower standard dwellings presented the largest GWi values. This was caused by the greater concentration of people per square meter in smaller area dwellings, resulting in larger water and energy consumption per square meter. The sensitivity analysis of FU variables such as lifetime and occupancy showed the GWi contribution of the infrastructure more relevant compared with the operation in high and basic standard dwellings. The definition of lifetime and occupancy parameters is key to avoid bias and to reduce uncertainty of the results when performing a comparison of dwelling environmental performances. Conclusions: This paper highlights the need for adequate choice and setting of FU to support intended decision-making in LCA studies of the building sector. The use of at least two FUs presented a broader picture of building performance, helping to guide effective environmental optimization efforts from different approaches and levels of analysis. Information regarding space, time, and service dimensions should be either included in the FU setting or provided in the building LCA study to allow adjustment of the results for subsequent comparison. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease associated with poverty. It is estimated that 7.1 million people are infected with Schistosoma mansoni in Latin America, with 95% of them living in Brazil. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment are important measures to control and eliminate schistosomiasis, but diagnostic improvements are needed to detect infections, especially in areas of low endemicity. Methodology: This research aimed to evaluate the performance of 11 diagnostic tests using latent class analysis (LCA). A cross-sectional survey was undertaken in a low endemicity area of the municipality of Malacacheta, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Feces, urine, and blood samples were collected from 400 residents older than 6 years of age, who had not been treated with praziquantel in the 12 months previous to the collection of their samples. The collected samples were examined using parasitological (Helm Test® kit Kato-Katz), nucleic acid amplification tests -NAATs (PCR, qPCR and LAMP on urine; PCR-ELISA, qPCR and LAMP on stool), and immunological (POC-CCA, the commercial anti-Schistosoma mansoni IgG ELISA kit from Euroimmun, and two in-house ELISA assays using either the recombinant antigen PPE or the synthetic peptide Smp150390.1) tests. Results: The positivity rate of the 11 tests evaluated ranged from 5% (qPCR on urine) to 40.8% (commercial ELISA kit). The estimated prevalence of schistosomiasis was 12% (95% CI: 9–15%) according to the LCA. Among all tests assessed, the commercial ELISA kit had the highest estimated sensitivity (100%), while the Kato-Katz had the highest estimated specificity (99%). Based on the accuracy measures observed, we proposed three 2-step diagnostic approaches for the active search of infected people in endemic settings. The approaches proposed consist of combinations of commercial ELISA kit and NAATs tests performed on stool. All the approaches had higher sensitivity and specificity than the mean values observed for the 11 tests (70.4 and 89.5%, respectively). Conclusion: We showed that it is possible to achieve high specificity and sensitivity rates with lower costs by combining serological and NAATs tests, which would assist in the decision-making process for appropriate allocation of public funding aiming to achieve the WHO target of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem by 2030.

	abstract = {Severance savings accounts (SSA) is an important government program aimed at protecting laid-off workers and stimulating savings. We analyze the distributive and aggregate effects of SSA in a rich life-cycle model with heterogeneous agents and incomplete markets. The model is estimated to be consistent with micro and macro data from Brazil. Our analysis reveals that, despite a decrease in voluntary savings, the policy expands aggregate savings, output, and wages, leading to long-run welfare gains. We show that although better risk sharing is important for our findings, the bulk of the gains come from improved efficiency as labor productivity increases and labor supply is reallocated towards highly educated workers and the early stages of the life cycle where agents are generally poorer and leisure is less valued. Interestingly, most of the gains we find accrue to less educated agents as the distribution of this group is skewed towards the informal sector, and they do not directly incur the additional burden from the increase in contributions. We also explore an alternative policy design in which households are allowed to access their severance savings accounts only after retirement, as in a defined contribution pension system. We find that despite greater uncertainty in medical costs later in life, households prefer a more flexible system that provides access to the SSA fund during working-age and after retirement. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Latent class analysis (LCA) is an alternative and innovative approach to verify the relation of the various combinations of the constructed environment and movement behavior (levels of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep) characteristics. This study aimed to identify latent classes based on the characteristics of the neighborhood environment perceived by adolescents and their association with gender, socioeconomic status (SS), body composition and movement behaviors. Methods: This cross-sectional study includes 309 Brazilian adolescents (14 to 16 years old, 57% female). The characteristics of the neighborhood environment perceived were analyzed by the Neighborhood Walkability for Youth Scale. Accelerometers were used for a week to evaluate the movement behaviors. Questionnaires assessed the screen times, total sitting time (TST), and sociodemographic characteristics. LCA was used for modeling the “Perceived Enviroment” variable, having been conducted in the poLCA (Polychromous Variable Latent Class Analysis) package of the R statistical software. Results: Three classes were recognized: class 1, “Best Perceived Environment” with 23.03% of adolescents; class 2, “Moderate Perceived Environment”, 63.33%; and class 3, “Worst Perceived Environment”, 13.67%. Light physical activity (LPA), TST, and SS were associated with class prevalence. The adolescents with medium and low SS were, respectively, 3.42 (95% CI 1.62–7.21) and 4.18 (95% CI 1.66–10.50) more likely to belong to class 2, and those with low SS were 5.21 (95% CI 1.35–20.13) more likely to belong to class 3. Class 1 adolescents were associated with a lower chance (OR: 0.09, 95% CI 0.02–0.55) of involvement in ‘adequate LPA time’ compared to class 3. Class 1 adolescents were associated with a lower chance (OR: 0.31, 95% CI 0.12–0.79) of involvement in ‘adequate TST’ compared to class 2. There was a difference between the LPA and TST classes; class 3 presented a longer time in LPA than class 1; class 1 had higher TST than the other classes. Conclusion: The findings highlight the influence of neighborhood classes on adolescents’ LPA and TST. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The aim of this paper is to analyze the dismounting process of two commercial buildings in San Francisco Bay (California, United States). For this study, a case study was conducted with two partial demolition projects. The first phase aimed to identify and analyze the management of recycling and reuse. The second phase focused on studying the deconstruction project and characterizing the deconstruction. Finally, the last phase quantified and constructed indicators on the recycled or reused materials. Results identified that developments 1 and 2 generated construction and demolition waste (CDW) of 63.7 and 21.5 kg/m² during the deconstruction process, with recycling rates of 9.8% and 81.3%, respectively. Despite the legislation requiring the redirection of these materials, California, as well as Brazil, still lacks specific aspects in the legislation regarding waste, to encourage and require that these issues be considered still in the initial design phase of the construction. © 2024, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

Energy efficiency measures for the building envelope were evaluated in representative single-family and multifamily typology projects for the lower-income sector, considering thermal autonomy, energy consumption and cost indicators. The measures estimated in terms of macrocomponents allowed for comparative evaluation and association with costs. Cases were simulated in EnergyPlus to obtain the building's expected operational consumption. With the macrocomponents and simulation data, Python routines were used to compute results for each proposed combination. Optimal cases that present high thermal performance in the national standard (NBR 15575) with cost-effectiveness, offering guidelines for projects in the 8 Brazilian bioclimatic zones, were established. Results presented in more detail for bioclimatic zone 8 showed optimal cases, with the increase in the percentage of hours of thermal autonomy reaching 65%–71%, whereas that of a typical building was 30%, while life cycle cost related to the envelope showed reductions of up to 22%, even with higher initial costs.

	abstract = {In Brazil, the procedure for obtaining a Certificate of Occupancy is bureaucratic, time-consuming and dependent on decisions that should have been taken in the early execution phases or even during design approval phases. Considering that fit for occupancy legalization is an important milestone in the life cycle of a real estate construction project, this research describes how the Pull Planning approach has been used to ensure that construction planning could reach the whole construction life cycle: since the design phase until customer hand over. The Pull Planning workshops were part of a larger project considering Lean Construction implementation in a large construction company in Brazil. Nine Pull Planning Workshops were applied when mapping the life cycle of a real estate construction company. This research will describe how the Lean Philosophy was applied and what benefits the Pull Planning workshops brought to the whole project planning perspective in terms of communication, collaboration and decision-making process clearer. A survey was conducted with the workshop participants to understand which benefits were perceived and which improvements could be implemented in the method. The results are that the Company succeeded in standardizing a new Planning tool that clarifies the whole life cycle of projects. The main benefits that the workshop participants highlighted are: Collaboration and multidisciplinary involvement in the Workshops, Clarity of information, View of the whole project and View of sequence. © 2022 30th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2022.

	abstract = {Permeable pavements have been the subject of numerous studies in recent decades. The possibility of dissipating stormwater more smoothly and generating numerous benefits to the environment and users makes the use of permeable pavements an excellent possibility of integration into sustainable and resilient water management systems in cities. In Brazil, numerous studies on the quantity and quality of infiltrated water, permeability of the coating, clogging, environmental burden, and feasibility, among other characteristics, have been researched. Within this theme, the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) has contributed with ten papers in the research of permeable pavements in the last six years, which address various topics about the effectiveness and applicability of permeable pavements. This paper reviews the studies conducted at UFSC on permeable pavements and discusses the different results within the main issues found. In general, the selected documents addressed seven themes in the studies: potential for potable water savings, clogging, quantity and quality of the water infiltrated into the pavement, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and its variants, and hydraulic and structural design details. More specifically, many selected papers assess the potential use of stormwater harvested through permeable pavements in non-potable uses of buildings. The possibility of aligning the benefits of green infrastructure with the rational use of water expands the advantages of the system and can help prevent future water scarcity, as well as reduce the environmental impacts of paving. © 2021 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In Brazil, healthcare buildings are acknowledged for their architectural complexity, because they are designed to cater to a heterogeneous and vulnerable public. Building performance assessments (BPEs) offer an alternative means to comprehend the authentic state of these structures and to identify potential enhancements. However, due to the multidisciplinary nature of healthcare buildings, the BPE process can be both extensive and intricate. Consequently, this research developed a systematic approach to BPE in healthcare by delineating and categorizing pertinent themes that are integral to the evaluation process. To achieve this objective, the research encompassed three distinct parts: (1) elaboration of the initial proposal for a BPE approach for healthcare buildings; (2) validation of identified themes and their organizational structure through the application of the Delphi method; and (3) conversion of the generated proposal into a quantitative approach with factors and weights for each dimension of the Healthcare BPE approach developed. The outcome of this rigorous process yielded a conceptual framework for Healthcare BPE comprising 6 dimensions, 25 criteria, and 201 subcriteria. These dimensions range from considerations of location to comfort, encompassing environmental and social issues. Additionally, the criteria were related systematically to distinct phases within the building's life cycle. This research effort resulted in the proposal of a Healthcare BPE approach that is capable of addressing critical concerns, aligned with either the various phases of the building or specific requirements. This structured and comprehensive approach will enhance the effectiveness of BPE in the context of healthcare buildings, providing a valuable tool for stakeholders involved in their design, construction, and ongoing management. © 2025 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {The urbanization process represented by an increased supply of housing and transport infrastructure has taken place at an accelerated rate in several regions of Brazil, especially in the metropolitan areas of the Brazilian Amazon. Despite the existence of environmental policies that guide the proper disposal of civil construction waste (CCW) in Brazil, the impacts of these policies are still negligible, pointing to the need to establish other metrics such as the measurement of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in CO2eq associated with civil construction waste. This work aims to evaluate, in the second-largest city in the Brazilian Amazon, the environmental impact generated by the transportation of CCW to disposal sites, having as indicators the volume of this waste and the CO2 emissions produced during a whole year. A literature review on life cycle carbon emissions assessment in building construction and CO2 emissions in transportation are provided to establish the background of the research methodology. Data collection was carried out by searching large generators of construction waste, the companies responsible for transporting construction waste, and the types of vehicles used. Calculation of GHG emissions from CCW transportation was based on the method described in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The study identified a volume of waste of around 1244 m3/month, with a generation of 40,440 kgCO2/year, only from small and large generators. Besides the damage identified in this study, there is also the dumping of CCW into urban streams in the city which is causing negative impacts on sanitation and drainage systems. The results point to the need to strengthen local policies to mitigate the impacts of the existing CCW to contribute to a more sustainable city. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection with high re-emergence rates in some Amazon regions. The main vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi are haematophagous insects, the triatomines. Only a few reports are available about the occurrence of these wild vectors and their contact with the inhabitants of the riverside regions of the Amazon. This study describes the unusual behaviour of the triatomines that have invaded the homes of the residents of Abaetetuba, the city that has the second highest number of cases of Chagas disease. Methods: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted using sero-epidemiological surveys of the inhabitants of Abaetetuba with registered triatomine home invasions. The frequencies of the variables of interest were analysed using Epi Info version 7.2. Results: In 2014 and 2017, 145 persons registered home invasions of triatomines in their domiciles and 16.55% reported having been bitten by insects. The environmental features described indicated potential conditions for the persistence of the parasite's life cycle. Of the enrolled inhabitants, 0.47% were positive for immunoglobulin G anti-T. cruzi antibodies. Conclusions: Home invasions of triatomines were confirmed in two periods, with a description of unusual behaviour for the genus Rhodnius. The use of serological surveillance in human populations at risk of this occurrence may constitute a new tool for the early detection of silent infections. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Wet ethanol is a promising biofuel whose properties fit with turbocharged direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engines for countries with yearly production capacity. Even though it has a higher life-cycle efficiency than regular ethanol, which reduces significantly the energy required on ethanol production, wet ethanol's potential is wasted by the continuous dehydration process. In order to highlight such potential as a fuel for engines, this study investigates the early injection of different blends of wet ethanol (E100W0, E95W5, E90W10, and E80W20, respectively) via an in-house engine simulator to improve engine operating conditions — enhancing engine and ethanol's life-cycle efficiencies. This study searched for the highest sustainable values of engine energy and exergy efficiencies based on the threshold value of the knock index number. The combustion phasing model used correlations obtained from a machine learning algorithm fed with experimental data for a DISI engine. This investigation provided 120 different cases under different compression ratios (r), engine speeds, relative air-fuel ratios, and wet ethanol blends. Results showed that E80W20 can operate with a turbocharger at r = 18. The highest efficiencies (43% and 40%, respectively) were found for E90W10 and E80W20 — values 30% higher than regular Brazilian FFV. Lastly, cases involving the best conditions for torque, lean air-fuel conditions at high compression ratios and water content, and downspeeding are presented as interesting alternatives to either stationary engines or hybrid vehicles, therefore highlighting the potential of wet ethanol for DI engines. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a valuable tool to enhance the environmental performance of buildings. However, the increasing number of impact categories required by construction LCA standards makes it difficult to collect primary data and understand LCA results. Furthermore, most LCA studies only analyse aggregated impact results, failing to identify the specific processes that should be optimized to mitigate environmental impacts. This work shows the additional insights that can be gained from analysing disaggregated LCA results. We identify the specific elementary processes and flows causing each environmental impact for a typical Brazilian building used as a case study. This cradle-to-grave LCA study covers the 16 impact categories required by EN 15804. The findings reveal that the environmental impacts of buildings are primarily caused by a few elementary processes and flows. Multiple impact categories share common sources, implying that at least half of the indicators convey redundant information for decision-making as they point to the same actions for mitigating those impacts. Additionally, some impacts are caused by background elementary processes beyond the influence of construction stakeholders. Interpreting LCA results at the elementary process level allows us to reflect on the suitability of LCA to support decisions. It suggests potential strategies to streamline the LCA scope currently specified in construction LCA standards by excluding redundant indicators or impacts determined by uncontrollable background processes. Streamlining LCA can expedite the adoption of the life cycle approach in the construction sector and improve its contribution to informed decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper was to present the stages of the Brazilian startups' organizational life cycle (OLC), identifying and describing the main factors related to the entrepreneurial and organizational perspectives, as well as the factors related to external relationship agents and the associated risks at each OLC stage. In addition, the variables that comprised the three perspectives above were used for a descriptive reading of the evolutionary process from the perspective of intellectual capital during the stages. Design/methodology/approach: The type of research used was quantitative with a descriptive character. For data collection, the authors have used the survey method and two complementary questionnaires were used as research tools. The measurement scale used in these instruments was the 11-point Likert scale. In total, 100 Brazilian startups registered in the STARTUPBASE and residents in São Paulo comprised the sample of this research. For the data processing, it was used the exploratory factor analysis techniques, to identify the analysis factors, and the cluster analysis, to identify the OLC stages. Findings: Based on the results obtained, four stages were identified and described to build the OLC model of this research: Stage I – conception and development; Stage II – organization and traction; Stage III – growth and scale; and Stage IV – consolidation and transition. In addition, the authors described the main lines of evidence found at each stage. Practical implications: This research contributes to academic studies of the OLC in startups and the evolution of risks that originate from the relationship between external agents in the business environment and startups. Thus, a management map is built, which helps entrepreneurs and managers construct these businesses since such a management map allows identifying the risks and challenges that a startup needs to overcome to grow and develop. Originality/value: The originality of this research lies in the adaptation of the OLC approach, which is widely used in studies analyzing the growth and development of mature organizations. The authors used this adaptation to analyze the growth and development of startups in Brazil. In addition, the identification and analysis of external agents that make up the business environment, as well as the analysis of the risks, originated from the relationships between the startup and these agents, brought original and essential results and discussions, both for OLC studies and for risk analysis studies in startups. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Buildings are responsible for the energetic consumption and potential greenhouse gas emissions during their life cycle. Water heating system contribute to a building’s energetic consumption, mainly in residential units, throughout the building’s operational phase. Variability in energy sources, reservation and distribution systems of hot water along with the types of construction materials used in these building systems are key decisions to make in the initial design phases of a building project. Often, the definition of the most appropriate water heating system for a building is made via a technical-economic decision. However, the decision is rarely based on natural resource consumption and environmental impact generation throughout the life-cycle of the heating systems and of buildings as a whole. This study presents an application of a specific environmental management tool, based on an integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life-Cycle Analysis (LCA) method for selection of hot water systems, during the early design building phase. The proposed approach is implemented in the pre-operational phase, in order to enable decision makers to appreciate the resulting environmental performance of water heating systems in buildings. The applicability of the framework is tested via a comparative study of solar heating water systems and natural gas heating water systems for a residential multifamily building to be constructed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For the indicators damage to human health and damage to ecosystem, results indicate that the greatest impact on global warming comes from the natural gas heating system, while for solar heating, free particulate matter was the highest negative contribution. The operation phase for the natural gas system was highest for climate change while for solar heating system, it was the fresh water that was impacted the most during the pre-operational phase of the system’s use. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {A multidisciplinary assessment of the sustainability status of 11 coastal small-scale fishery systems in the Brazilian Amazon was performed using the Rapfish method with 31 indicators representing six evaluation fields (ecological, economic, ethical, institutional, social, and technological). The method employs a constrained multidimensional scaling ordination technique; uncertainty is expressed through Monte Carlo simulation and sensitivity by leverage analysis. Results showed that most fishery systems were ecologically, economically, and socially ‘less satisfactory’ and institutionally and ethically ‘not sustainable’. Fishers have low levels of education and are highly reliant on fishing. They face low income, scarcity of alternative livelihoods, isolation from markets, weak political representation, and lack of regulatory measures and decision-making power. Fisheries target fishes with long life cycles and moderate to high vulnerability. Declining catches, increasing fishing effort and catching power, and competition with other fleets threatens the sustainability of fisheries. Recommendations include moving towards participatory management and governance, supporting the building of cohesive social organizations, and strengthening of human rights. New research and monitoring data and investments in capacity-building in research institutes and management agencies are required. The Rapfish method was employed with revised and new attributes, and the results demonstrate its applicability in data-poor scenarios in developing countries. © 2020},

	abstract = {Cleaning products changed the relation between humans and the environment. Its production and market demand are increasing annually in the world which increases these products’ assessment relevance. Its inappropriate use impacts, negatively, in the environment and human health problems. The Eco-efficiency assessment is a tool to identify the life cycle hotspots and to propose technically feasible improvements. This study was done based in the NBR ISO 14045:2014 for three detergents produced in Teresina-Piauí-Brazil, namely products A, B and C. Primary and secondary data regarding inputs, outputs and selling prices were collected from three different manufacturers, the Ecoinvent database and patents. The selling price was the product system value indicator. The results were related in an Eco-efficiency matrix. The assessed products had high environmental impacts in the categories of acidification, eutrophication, scarcity of fossil and mineral resources and water use. The use stage had the greatest impacts within the referred categories due to water consumption and wastewater treatment. For the product system value, detergents A and C had a lower selling prices than product B. All detergents had high environmental impacts, then the product system value was decisive for them to occupy the matrix quadrants' three or four. Detergent C was the best choice among the three products due to its lower environmental impacts in the selected categories and selling price. Through the sensitivity analysis, it was proposed environmentally viable changes in the product’s critical points, as changes in the product formula, for manufacturers, and water consumption reduction equipment, for users. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University.},

	abstract = {In this study, rodents (Rattus rattus) and mollusks (Achatina fulica) were captured in a small forest located in a large metropolitan city in Brazil, and they were examined to investigate possible parasitism by Angiostrongylus cantonensis. The parasites were recovered as helminths from the pulmonary arteries of the synanthropic rodents and as third-stage larvae (with Metastrongylidae family characteristics) from the mollusks. To confirm the species, these larvae were used to experimentally infect Rattus norvegicus for the posterior recovery of adult helminths. To identify the adult helminths, morphological, morphometric, molecular, and phylogenetic techniques were employed. Furthermore, we also characterized the histological lesions associated with parasitism in naturally infected definitive hosts. Our results demonstrated the occurrence of a natural life cycle of A. cantonensis (with the presence of adult helminths) in definitive hosts, Rattus rattus, and third-stage larvae in an intermediate host, A. fulica. In free-living rodents, lesions of granulomatous pneumonia in the lungs and meningitis in the brain were also found. These results warn of the risk of accidental transmission of A. cantonensis to human residents around the park because of the extensive interaction among the fauna of the park, domestic animals, and the surrounding human population. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to identify neighborhood profiles perceived by adolescents and young adults and estimate their association with global and leisure-time physical activity. Data from 1,637 individuals aged 15 to 24 years were taken from a cross-sectional study with cluster sampling, conducted in a city in the State of Bahia, Brazil, in 2011. Physical activity was measured using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), short version, in addition to a question about leisure activities. The perception of characteristics of the physical and social environment of the neighborhood was based on a scale with 14 questions. Neighborhood profiles were defined through latent class analysis (LCA), and the estimation of their effects on physical activity used a model with distal outcomes. The latent profile analysis resulted in three neighborhood patterns, described as "urban, sociable, and favorable to physical activity - class 1" (39.6%); "sociable and safe - class 2" (24.4%), "insecure, low sociability - class 3" (36%). Individuals belonging to "class 1" showed the highest probability to exercise (56.4%), while for classes 2 and 3 these percentages corresponded to 46.3% and 42.8%, respectively. A statistically significant association was identified only in the "urban, sociable and favorable to physical activity" class, whose chance of performing leisure activities was 72% (OR = 1.72; 95%CI: 1.29-2.29). Neighborhoods with attributes that favor the practice of physical activity and the existence of urbanization elements increase the chance of active leisure behavior among adolescents and young adults. The use of LCA and the model with distal outcomes are promising and innovative in neighborhood approaches. © 2022 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Wall construction is the most common application for 3D concrete printing (3DCP). This construction technique requires a printing material with specific rheological characteristics that are usually achieved through high cement consumptions, reaching more than 1000 kg/m³. It is well known that large-scale cement consumption is a worldwide concern, mainly due to carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, in the context of 3DCP structures, this environmental concern becomes even more relevant. Therefore, this work investigated the environmental performance, by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology, evaluating 14 environmental impact categories of 3DCP walls, and comparing them with conventional construction techniques in a social housing context of a Brazilian case study. The results confirmed that cement consumption provides the greatest contribution to the impact potentials for most of the evaluated categories, reaching 93% for climate change. So, materials that can be used to replace cement, such as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM), are important alternatives. In general, the comparative results showed that 3DCP can have a similar environmental performance to conventional construction techniques, when, instead of evaluating 1 m³ of concrete, the functional unit evaluated is 1 m2 of wall. Sensitivity analysis carried out showed that the printing parameter variations that most affect the consumption of concrete cause the greatest changes in potential environmental impacts, while alterations in the energy consumption, almost do not influence the total values of the potential impacts. Finally, this study presents a roadmap and a pathway for designers, developers, builders and researchers of 3DCP to decrease the life cycle environmental impacts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Poultry farming is often associated with negative environmental impacts, such as water quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions. This study covers important gaps in the geographic scope of poultry farming using Life Cycle Assessment analysis. Data on animal feed, energy, packaging, and waste were collected from the poultry industry in Rondônia, Brazil. The life cycle inventory included all inflows and outflows of feed production, poultry housing, slaughter, processing, the retail market, and the functional unit of “1 kg chicken meat with 0.22 kg protein”. The ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method was used for seven categories of impact. The results showed that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG, CO2, N2O and CH4) during the feed production phase was dominant, totaling 2.0 kg CO2-eq per kg of live weight produced. This stage was most relevant in six of seven categories of impacts assessed. During the poultry housing stage, terrestrial acidification was dominated by emissions of NH3, P and N2O from one-day-old chicks (hatching eggs, poultry house litter, and feed). The total environmental impact of producing broilers in Brazil amounted to 3.37 kg CO2-eq per kg of meat at the consumer market gate. The LPG gas and biological waste from slaughterhouses was dominant in this phase. The retail stage revealed contributions above 43% in all impact categories due to high consumption of electricity (0.11 kWh (0.39 MJ) per kg of meat). Three scenarios were proposed and demonstrated, using biological residues as a source of nutrients for feed composition. The results showed that using poultry viscera meal led to better environmental outcomes for all impacted categories. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Few studies in the literature integrate rainwater harvesting and firefighting. Thus, the general objective of this paper was to evaluate the potential use of rainwater as a source of water for firefighting. To do so, two approaches were proposed for the assessment. The first approach was the analysis of the existing literature. Two databases were evaluated as references in engineering fields, of which 32 articles mentioned rainwater as an alternative for firefighting. The main result of the review was the scarcity of articles in the area under study, with some of the existing articles focusing on forest fires. In contrast, others analysed the use of rainwater within the scope of buildings or fire stations. The second approach involved a case study that started by analysing the fire statistics provided by the Military Fire Department of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. It was observed that, between 2017 and 2020, building fires represented 25 % of the state's fires and 50 % of the water consumption in firefighting, while the rest of the fire occurrences represented the other half of water consumption. Rainwater can be used not only to reduce the total consumption of potable water but also as a logistics tool towards better response time in the event of a fire. With the firefighting water demand obtained, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was performed to assess the potential environmental optimisation in a simplified scope. It was performed in a cradle-to-gate approach, leaving the potential optimisations in transport and logistics apart.

	abstract = {The use of pre-harvest fire in sugarcane fields surprisingly results in an increase in the abundance of Neotropical Sigmodontinae rodents, which might carry hantavirus. By contrast, fire suspension induces a decline in rodents in the first 5 years. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of sugarcane harvest regimes on hantavirus prevalence in wild rodents. Field collections were carried out on a sugarcane production area in Northeast São Paulo, which is responsible for 30% of the ethanol production in Brazil. A few years after pre-harvest fire suspension, a high prevalence of hantavirus was found in small rodents at lower population density, but apparently higher population growth rate. Differences in life cycle between the rodents and their predators may explain such density patterns, as small rodents can breed twice or even three times each year, whereas their predators usually breed only once a year. Similarly, the temporal dynamics of the predator–prey relationship suggests that hantavirus prevalence is related to small rodent's population growth and not density. Only Akodon montensis, Calomys tener, and Necromys lasiurus contained immunoglobulin G antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of Araraquara orthohantavirus, a genotype of Andes orthohantavirus, with no interspecific variation in seroprevalence among these species. However, males presented higher prevalence rate than females, possibly due to a male-biased dispersal pattern and a higher frequency of antagonistic interactions. Governance measures to mitigate the role of small wild rodents on the emergence of hantavirus in agricultural landscapes dominated by sugarcane plantations should include the use of wildlife-friendly management techniques (e.g., to mitigate the mortality of the predators of small rodents), human capacity building concerning wildlife-related conflicts, and multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes. Future studies should prioritize the possible relationship between microhabitat structure and hantavirus prevalence in small rodents in agricultural landscapes dominated by sugarcane fields. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Wood is a biological material; it is renewable and widely used in construction projects around the world. One of its main features is its ability to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and temporarily store carbon; this helps to mitigate climate change. This research analyzes strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and increase temporary carbon storage in the Brazilian construction sector by promoting the long-term use of planted wood for housing purposes. To this end, two strategies are developed: the first (SS1) proposes to increase the yield of the primary processing performance of sawn wood by 7.0%; the second (SS2) replaces the market share of wood products with a short life cycle (<1 year) with those with a long-life cycle (>40 years) in construction. It was found that, compared to the reference scenario, the implementation of SS1 and SS2 can mitigate ∼4% (27.6 MtCO2) and ∼1% (89.9 MtCO2), respectively, of accumulated emissions between 2024 and 2050. Temporary carbon storage can be increased by up to 6% (8.3 MtC) via the increase in wood frame houses, or up to 15% temporary carbon (20.4 MtC) via the increase in cross-laminated timber houses (hypothetical maximum potential values). A sensitivity analysis was performed considering native wood from both managed and unmanaged forests, and the results indicate that the proposals satisfy the objective only in the planted wood scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Methods: The review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). The searches were conducted in LILACS and PubMed databases (September/2022). Observational studies carried out in the Brazilian population published since 2003 were included, in which: (1) the association of FI with NCDs was analyzed; and (2) the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale was used. Studies on pregnant women and those that associated FI with cancer, sexually transmitted infections, and musculoskeletal and respiratory diseases were excluded. The studies were subjected to methodological quality assessment. Results: A total of 27 cross-sectional studies were included; nine used secondary data from national surveys, and the others used primary data. An association between FI and overweight and obesity in different age groups was verified in the studies. Conclusion: The included articles did not produce evidence on other NCDs of interest to health in Brazil such as diabetes and high blood pressure. However, they corroborate the already-known relationship between obesity and FI.

We propose several modifications, featuring a focus on extended families instead of single households, to broaden the applicability to land use systems. In the process, we pay particular attention to temporal dynamics and the spatial distribution of families concerning demographic processes, going beyond fertility to focus on population distribution. To evaluate the extended family model’s explanatory value, we apply it to the Transamazon Highway region in Brazil. The analysis includes 330 families, which are often multi-generational and multi-sited, based on data from 402 lots (1997/8–2005). We present models for forest, secondary succession, annual crops, perennials and pasture. Explanatory variables feature nine demographic factors with five others controlling for exogenous forces. The findings show strong effects for family dynamics and spatial distribution variables in many equations. Time on lot (cohort effect), the complexity of family structure (age effect) and social integration into urban fabric (spatial effect) are demographic processes that deserve further attention in land use studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.},

Additionally, the study underscores concerns related to finance, time, reputation, and health, which warrant consideration. Risk analysis uncovers internal and external risks and categorizes thirty-two risks, with one deemed unacceptable, thus revealing valuable insights into stakeholders’ partnerships, institutional image, public equipment, manufacturing, project management, human resources, intellectual property, regulation, and sanitation risks. Building on these findings, we develop a new framework illustrating the management of the urgent open innovation project through the fast-paced Quadruple Helix formation.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a popular method to analyze the environmental impacts of a product along the whole value chain, providing guidance to practices and technologies from environmental perspectives. However, the LCA research of RAP-modified pavement is seldom performed in Brazil. In addition, as an important source of uncertainties, there is also need of discussion regarding the geographical and technological characteristics in the LCA of pavements. For these motivations, this paper performs a cradle-to-gate LCA to compare the environmental performance of asphalt pavement in Brazil and Switzerland, using the practical rates of RAP use. The functional unit was defined based on the same traffic volume and service life of asphalt pavements, where the mix design and pavement structures follow the standards of the two countries. The results showed that RAP recycling can improve the environmental performance of hot asphalt mixtures in both countries. Binder amount has a high environmental burden and its reduced use by adding RAP has a positive environmental effect. Type of fuel also plays an important role in LCA. In Brazil, it is not recommended to use heavy oils as fuel during the mixing process if other options such as methane gas is available. The results show that the Swiss production of asphalt mixture had lower environmental impact. Nevertheless, a strategic location of material suppliers and mixing plants could lower the transportation distances, improving its environmental performance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Giardia duodenalis, a unicellular, eukaryotic, and flagellated protozoan, presents two evolutionary forms in its life cycle, namely, trophozoites and cysts. It causes diarrhea in humans, dogs, cats, rodents, and ungulates. Despite being morphologically similar, the isolates of G. duodenalis are genetically diverse, affecting the stability and unanimity of taxonomic classification. Since different Giardia assemblages may occur within one isolate, multilocus genotyping is recommended for the genetic identification. Methodology: To determine the frequency of G. duodenalis infections in domiciled dogs in Cuiabá Municipality (State of Mato Grosso, Midwestern Brazil) and characterize its genetic variability, fecal samples were collected from 147 dogs. Results: Overall, 6.8% (10/147) of the samples presented cysts of G. duodenalis, which sequencing and genotypic characterization using tpi and gluD revealed assemblages C and A, genetic grouping of G. duodenalis. Only three samples amplified by tpi and one sample amplified by gluD. Conclusions: The risk factors age, gender, breed, diet and the presence of other dogs in the same house were not correlationated with giardiasis. The host-specific and zoonotic genotype warns of the risk of inter and intraspecies transmission and it provides, for the first time, information about genetic characterization of G. duodenalis isolates in dogs in Cuiabá, Midwest region of Brazil.

	abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely used in recent years in swine and chicken production systems. This methodology aims to analyze the environmental aspects and measure the environmental impact of a product throughout its life cycle. Thus, this review will evaluate the application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in the Chicken and swine production system. to identify differences in LCA and explore the causes of variations between current works, main methodological differences in studies of the life cycle of swine and chickens, and explore the different values found in the literature in relation to greenhouse gas emissions for the same functional unit (FU). In swine and chicken production, values from 1.40 to 5.78 kgCO2-eq and 1.05 to 9.35 kgCO2-eq, per kg live weight, are observed, respectively. This variability occurs as a result of, some authors perform the calculation for only one production phase (for example, only the finishing phase without considering the sows that generated the piglets to be slaughtered); others carry out an evaluation of only one productive phase (piglets from 7 to 35 days of age). There are studies considering the addition of several factors, such as animal feed, water, housing and transport. Choices such as defining boundaries (“from cradle to farm gate” or “from cradle to slaughter”), animal density, consideration of Land Use Change (LUC) and whether irrigation is used in grain production for animal feed often alter outcomes. The greatest impact of both production systems is associated with food - when LUC is added to the calculation, the impact is even more pronounced. The consideration of the LUC in soy production, especially in Brazil, is a recurring debate among the studies evaluated, about whether or not to include the deforestation factor; In conclusion, it is necessary to make the assessment as complete as possible, and the main objective of future studies should be to increase transparency regarding the criteria used in the LCAs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Laundry is a frequent household activity, performed either manually or by washing machine. This process consumes chemical products (such as laundry detergent and fabric softener), electricity, and water. It is therefore important to understand the environmental impacts and costs associated with laundry. The goal of this paper was to assess its eco-efficiency based on the NBR ISO 14045:2014 standard. Methods: Primary data were collected from laundry detergent and fabric softener producers in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil. Secondary data were collected from patents, a chemical industry association, the government labeling program, and municipal water and electricity suppliers. The product system boundaries were cradle-to-consumer, and the impact categories were global warming, freshwater eutrophication, and land use. The product system value indicator was the washing costs from the consumer's perspective. The environmental and product system value indicators were related using the eco-efficiency formula which resulted in the process eco-efficiency profile. An uncertainty analysis was carried out to measure errors intrinsic to the data and the methods. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to identify the influence of choices made during the study and to propose viable technical improvements. Results: The results showed that the most impactful processes in the three categories were electricity, wastewater treatment, and the chemical products (laundry detergent and fabric softener). In terms of product system value, the costs of water and sewage treatment had the highest contribution to the overall costs. It was not possible to identify the laundry eco-efficiency profile degree and to calculate the X factor, due to the lack of studies in this area. Greater uncertainties were found in the global warming category, due to its global scope, while freshwater eutrophication category has country-specific characterization factors. A new scenario was proposed to identify possible economically and environmentally feasible changes. However, it did not generate significant changes that would improve the eco-efficiency profile of the evaluated process. Conclusions: This work highlights the eco-efficiency importance as an environmental management tool to support business decision-making and to identify the environmental impacts of domestic activities. By the results, washers and laundry products manufacturers know which areas they should invest in research and development to reduce their products' impacts. For future studies, it is recommended to evaluate the use of a detergent that does not require fabric softener, such as those sold by the brands Biozgreen, TerpenOil, and Yvy in the Brazilian market, and a high-efficiency washer.

The present study evaluated the use of ASA from the Brazilian Amazon as partial Portland cement replacement in self-leveling mortars (SLM) for social-interest buildings. The fresh and hardened state properties of mortars were accessed with 5% and 10% ASA content, and a life cycle assessment was performed to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The maximum transport distance to enable ASA as a building material was determined by a sensitivity analysis, and specific carbon-efficiency indicators for SLM were proposed and validated. The results showed that using up to 10% ASA as cement replacement was technically and environmentally feasible since the mechanical performance was maintained and GHG emissions decreased up to 8%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that transport efficiency is crucial for ASA applications far from its production area; therefore, it should be evaluated as a regional building material. The work brings an important contribution to regional sustainable development by assessing the characteristics of a residual material and proposing the reuse of waste, reducing GHG emissions from the cement industry, and stimulating the circular bioeconomy in the Brazilian Amazon region. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Movement is a key factor that shapes the distribution and structure of fish populations and influences the extent of the benefits provided by conservation and management measures, such as the implementation of marine no-take zones (NTZs). We used visual surveys and acoustic telemetry to investigate density and movement of 2 Brazilian endemic and highly targeted reef fish species inside and outside a coral reef NTZ, and subsequently inferred the effectiveness of the NTZ for protecting these species. To do so, visual surveys were performed on protected and unprotected reefs between 2016 and 2017. Moreover, 20 gray parrotfish Sparisoma axillare and 9 Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei were tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored from December 2016 to October 2017. For both species, fish densities were significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost. The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs, predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were small (0.10 to 0.45 km2), and both species presented spatially segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88% for S. axillare and 95% for L. alexandrei. The results showed that small NTZs that are important to part of the life cycle of a target species are an effective measure to conserve reef fish populations, and also highlight the importance of fisheries management outside NTZs. © Inter-Research 2022},

	abstract = {The technical viability of using of the vegetable fibers as a reinforcement for building materials has been attested in several previous studies. However, there was a gap in the scientific literature regarding its environmental viability. Thus, this study was developed in order to fill this gap. This work presents a life cycle assessment (LCA), from cradle to gate, for jute and malva fibers grown in the Brazilian Amazon, as well as for a composite produced with these fibers, which has applications in the construction industry. In addition, the environmental burden of one ton of jute and malva fibers grown in this region was compared to that of one ton of sisal fibers grown in northeastern Brazil. The jute and malva fibers were evaluated as the reinforcement of the composite from two perspectives: one without processing and the other in the form of fabric. Primary data regarding the production of fibers, from its cultivation to its transformation into fabric, were collected via interviews. Using the ReCiPe 2016 methods (Endpoint and Midpoint) and EN 15804, it was observed that most of the environmental burden of the composite is due to the production of the raw materials of the cement and the superplasticizer. If the fibers were used without any processing, being only transported from a city near Manaus, the reduction of the impacts related to the reinforcement of the composite would be greater than 95%. These results confirmed the importance of using local raw materials. This composite reinforced with vegetable fibers has a low environmental impact and its commercial production could contribute to a bioeconomy based on the generation of green employment in local fiber-producing communities. © 2022},

	abstract = {The effective implantation of the circular economy (CE) presents a great challenge to the industrial sectors, mostly in those of greater environmental impact, such as construction industry. In Brazil, this industry has been growing over the last 20 years; however, such growth was based on an extractivist economy without any consideration to the end of its products lifespan. Only in 2017, 45 million tonnes of construction and demolition waste were generated in the country. This paper presents the current context of public policies in the Brazilian construction industry and proposes initiatives to introduce principles of CE. An exploratory study was developed, and all the 45 references presented in Appendix A of the review paper of Benachio et al. were considered to draw new ideas. These ideas are related and compared to key points in Brazilian regulations. Twelve opportunities for the improvement are listed and organized by construction stages (planning and design, materials manufacturing, construction processes, use and demolition). The ones related to design and planning using Green building information modelling, and materials manufacturing with recycled waste are highlighted due to the existing actions, standards, and Federal legislation. It was found that some sectors and the government already have actions related to CE (based on the 3R principle), but still there are several initiatives needed for its effective implementation in the Brazilian construction industry. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {In the last decades, the initial phase of the design process has been discussed from the point of view of the construction process economy contribution. In this sense, several authors highlight the decisions made at this stage as an impacting point of influence on the direct cost of the building. This concern is repeated in the cases investigated by the ZEMCH (Zero Energy Mass Custom Homes) group in Brazil, which is focused on social housing, consequently, cost becomes a fundamental factor that must be considered on these buildings' life cycle. Furthermore, ZEMCH's workshops in Brazil have characterized the initial phase of the design process as a process that requires speed and simultaneous control of a large amount of data by the designers. Over these perspectives, the objective of this work in progress is to verify the potential of a diagrammatic artifact as an intuitive tool of visualizing information and supporting decision making in the initial phase of the urban land subdivision design process, to obtain energy efficiency during the building's life cycle. Therefore, diagramming information of the environmental conditions into a visualization tool, helps designers to deal with requirements of this phase and cause impact on the operational cost of the building. This research was conducted over the Design Science Research method, and concludes that although visualizing information with the aid of an artifact can play an important role for the practical requirements of the early design phases, the solution can be potentially expanded to other purposes such as teaching, and even for users self-awareness on the operational impact. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This study conducts a life cycle assessment and exergoenvironmental evaluation of a double-effect vapor absorption chiller (DEAC) with a cooling capacity of 352 kW, employing three different energy sources: natural gas, biomethane, and green hydrogen. The main objectives of this paper are as follows: (i) provide an exergoenvironmental model for DEAC technologies, (ii) evaluation of a case-study where a DEAC is used to cover the cooling demand of a specific university building in the Northeast of Brazil, and (iii) evaluate the scenario where the DEAC is fed by green hydrogen (GH2) and compare it with conventional energy resources (natural gas and biomethane). In order to develop the exergoenvironmental model, two methodologies are essential: a thermodynamic analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The thermodynamic analysis was carried out using the Engineering Equation Solver (EES: 10.998) software. The LCA has been developed through the open-source software openLCA version 1.10.3, with the Ecoinvent 3.7.1 life cycle inventory database, whereas the chosen life cycle inventory assessment (LCIA) method was the ReCiPe Endpoint LCA method (Humanitarian, medium weighting–H, A). The main results indicate that green hydrogen provides a 99.84% reduction in environmental impacts compared to natural gas during the operational phase, while biomethane reduces these impacts by 54.21% relative to natural gas. In the context of life cycle assessment (LCA), green hydrogen decreases fossil resource depletion by 18% and climate change-related emissions by 33.16% compared to natural gas. This study contributes to enhancing the understanding of the environmental and exergoenvironmental impacts of a double-effect vapor absorption chiller by varying the fuel usage during the operational phase. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study analyzed construction waste prevention measures applied to a social housing project, with life cycle assessment (LCA), by three scenarios: base case scenario (BCS) – a single family house built with masonry blocks; prevention scenario 1 (PS1) – BCS assuming a theoretical optimization in materials consumption; prevention scenario 2 (PS2) – a house built with cast-in-situ concrete walls. The prevention scenarios showed waste reductions of 4% (PS1) and 36% (PS2). The environmental impacts have been evaluated by using CML baseline v.3.05; the impact categories were selected according to the EN 15.978:2011: global warming potential (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), ozone layer depletion (ODP), photochemical ozone formation (POF), abiotic depletion (AD), and abiotic depletion – fossil fuels (ADF). The PS1 reduced environmental impacts by 5% whereas PS2 increased by 15%, compared with BCS. The most critical construction steps for BCS and PS1 were coating and superstructure, whereas for PS2 were superstructure and painting. The materials extraction and production stage represent about 90% of the total impacts. The most critical materials for BCS and PS1 were concrete, cement, and steel, whereas for PS2 those were concrete, steel, and paint. The most relevant categories for the three scenarios analyzed were GWP, ADF, and AP. The waste management stage was irrelevant in generating impacts, contributing for less than 1% of the total impacts. These results highlight that despite reducing waste generation, prevention does not necessarily reduce the overall impacts of the edification, and therefore, the materials and construction methods used are especially relevant. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Masonry wall is a key construction subsystem, but it embodies significant environmental and energy burdens within the life cycle of buildings. Soil-cement bricks and blocks stand as an alternative low-cost masonry material, but despite the widespread claim to be environmentally friendly, more systematic investigation is lacking. This study aimed to assess the life cycle environmental and energy performance of 1.0 m2 of a soil-cement brick masonry wall from cradle-to-construction in terms of carbon, energy, and water footprints, and fossil and mineral resource use, as well as compare it with conventional technologies such as ceramic and concrete block masonries in Brazil. Results showed that raw materials are a major contribution to soil cement masonry walls, followed by the joints and links with columns, in which cement stands out among other inputs. Hydraulic pressing in brick production had a negligible burden increase compared with manual pressing. The PVA mortar joint outperformed the PVA glue one, whereas resin coating performed better than cement mortar. In comparison with ceramic and concrete masonry walls, the soil cement masonry presented overall better environmental and energy performance and was the least affected by the inclusion of finishing coating layers and transport of materials in the sensitivity analysis scenarios, although improved scenarios of conventional options could be competitive, e.g., ceramic masonry with blocks produced by firing reforested wood for the carbon footprint. Scale-up analysis revealed that widespread deployment of soil cement masonry in the built environment would substantially avoid environmental and energy burdens compared with conventional technologies. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Health risk behaviors often emerge or intensify during adolescence and tend to co-occur, exposing individuals to an even greater risk for the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The likelihood of exhibiting multiple health risk factors also increases throughout life and is associated with sociodemographic characteristics contributing to their escalation and severity. In this context, the objective of this study was to analyze the association between sociodemographic characteristics and multiple behavioral risk factors for non-communicable diseases among the adolescent population in Brazil. Methods: This cross-sectional study utilized data from the Brazilian National Survey of School Health 2019. The sample comprised 121,580 adolescents aged 13 to 17. The analyzed variables included irregular intake of fruits and vegetables, regular consumption of soft drinks and treats, insufficient physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. To analyze MBRFs, a classification ranging from zero to five was created, and associations were estimated using Odds Ratio (OR) with the respective 95% confidence interval (CI). The Backward method was employed for the multivariate regression model, utilizing ordinal logistic regression. Results: Adolescents without behavioral risk factors for NCDs constituted only 3.9% (95% CI 3.7–4.1). The most prevalent categories were two and three MBRFs, accounting for 28.3% (95% CI: 27.7–28.8) and 27.0% (95% CI: 26.5–27.5), respectively. Adolescents aged 16 and 17 (ORadj: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.32–1.48), residing in the Brazilian Southeast (ORadj: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.52–1.81), and those reporting poor or very poor self-rated health (ORadj: 2.05; 95% CI: 1.87–2.25) were more likely to exhibit multiple behavioral risk factors. Conversely, male adolescents (adjusted OR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.62–0.69), those of mixed race (adjusted OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87–0.97), and residents of rural areas (adjusted OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70–0.84) were less likely to manifest MBRFs for NCDs. Conclusion: The majority of adolescents displayed MBRFs for NCDs, positively associated with age, region, and perceived health status. This underscores the necessity for healthcare promotional interventions throughout the life cycle, as these behaviors may persist into adulthood. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {This work presents an evaluation and comparison of the environmental impacts generated in the vertical sealing subsystem of a single-family residential unit, using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of ceramic blocks and concrete blocks applied in the same unit. The research is justified by the possibility of using LCA method to increase the sustainability of the construction process. The novelty herein is to identify the critical points (i.e. the respiratory effects, the intensive use of fossil fuels, and the consequent climate changes) in the LCA of the building materials of two types of masonry commonly used in Brazil, namely ceramic blocks and concrete blocks. The method adopted is following the recommendations of ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, including the four main phases. It was also integrated the EcoInvent as an endpoint method and Eco-indicator 99. Ecoinvent is of foreign origin, it does not accurately portray the Brazilian reality, however, it was used because there are still no data at the national level. The Analysis of the environmental impact of particular systems may help select building materials, about the environmental performance at an early designing phase of buildings. Categories were established based on the endpoint categories that are ecosystem quality (EQ), human health (HH), and natural resources (R). This work insight that the ceramic blocks appear to have the highest impacts concerning the R, with 46%, while for the same impact the production of the concrete block represents 69%. There is still a higher environmental impact in the case of masonry in concrete blocks, mainly due to the brick burning stage in the cement manufacturing process. The masonry in ceramic bricks has its highest impact due to the step of burning the bricks. It is noted that both construction methods have the same critical points, however, the analysis of the environmental impact of particular systems may help select building materials, concerning the environmental performance in the early project phase. As a scientific contribution this study shows that LCA methodology can be a very useful and appropriate tool in sustainability studies in the construction industry. It is recognized that despite the inherent limitations of conducting an LCA based on a case study, the results will serve as a benchmark for Brazil brick production. © 2021},

	abstract = {This study applies a Lagrangian approach to identify the origin of moisture for subtropical cyclones (SCs) along their tracks in the South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) basin from 1980 to 2015. The analysis shows that the local evaporation cannot fully explain the moisture gained by SCs, highlighting the role of external sources in moisture support, mainly through the northeasterly winds associated with the South Atlantic Subtropical Anticyclone. Overall, the northwestern SAO was the principal moisture source for SCs. It was noticeable that its contribution (~40%–45%) remained quasi-constant during the year. Conversely, the moisture supplied from the northeastern SAO, southwestern SAO and the terrestrial source southeastern Brazil exhibited a marked seasonal variability. While contributions from the southwestern SAO intensify (weaken) in austral winter (summer), the southeastern Brazil source is more intense (weak) in summer (winter). In addition, SCs predominantly gain atmospheric humidity from sources close to their position, which reduces the mean water vapor residence time to ~3.2 days. Interestingly, we also found that ~42%–47% of the moisture that reached the SCs precipitates. These findings constitute a further step toward improving our knowledge of mechanisms underlying SC activity in the SAO basin. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Hydropower plants (HPPs) play an important role in the Brazilian energy matrix, largely in the Amazon region where the largest amount of hydropower generation potential is found. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze socioeconomic impacts caused in the stages of building and operating a large HPP in the Legal Amazon region. For such a purpose, the socioeconomic impacts detected in environmental studies of five projects (Belo Monte, Jirau, Peixe Angical, São Manoel and São Salvador) were analyzed. Socioeconomic impacts were sorted out according to the stage of their life cycle (construction and operation); these impacts were compared using a matrix and a descriptive analysis of data. Many similarities and correlations between the socioeconomic impacts were found in five studies. During the analysis, it was found that numerous impacts were improperly mitigated in these studies. Furthermore, social costs, such as population relocation, are typically underestimated, and gains brought by operating the HPP are overestimated. It is expected that an assessment of socioeconomic impacts caused by HPP in the Legal Amazon is going to allow broadening discussions about these constructions in areas of socioenvironmental sensitivity. Moreover, it is found that socioeconomic impacts in assessed studies are associated with multiple conflicts between the population affected by the project, government, and enterprise. © 2023, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

However, the extant literature has not fully explained the effects of demographic changes on land use and livelihoods sustainability that reconciles production and conservation. Using a case study of 28 years in the Brazilian Amazon, this article provided novel empirical evidences on the co-evolution of household demographic dynamics (composition and life cycles), land use and livelihoods as depicted by the demo-livelihoods theoretical framework. Methods of analysis involve the combination of exploratory (descriptive, cluster and correlation) and a multivariate hazard model. The results validated the demo-livelihoods theory and showed that livelihoods adaptation over time involves diversification combining perennials and cattle ranching, land consolidation and off-farm strategies (remittances, wage labor, cash transfers). These strategies are conditioned by demographic dynamics. Households are less likely to diversify livelihoods with annual crops due to unsustainable environmental conditions and costs associated with land intensification and market accessibility. While diversification historically occur at the expense of primary forest, household ageing may create a momentum to limit deforestation and allows the future incorporation of plot-based natural capital as a source of diversified, sustainable land uses and livelihoods for carbon emissions and bioeconomy markets. © 2023 by the author.},

	abstract = {As building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions rise globally, retrofitting existing structures offers a pathway toward more sustainable construction practices. However, balancing improvements to technical performance with financial constraints poses challenges. Specifically, whether coordinated implementation of energy retrofits and on-site photovoltaic generation provides synergistic benefits worthy of initial capital investment remains mostly unclear. To address this, the present study evaluates the economic and energy performance impacts of integrated retrofit and renewable energy integration strategies for a university building in Recife, Brazil. In this study, a calibrated building energy model simulated conservation measures and photovoltaic sizing under varying optimization objectives and sensitivities. The most significant contribution lies in its holistic, location-specific approach to achieving near-zero energy status within the educational facility through optimized retrofit strategies. This includes incorporating real-world metered energy data to calibrate the model and inform cost assessments, enhancing practical relevance. Tabu search optimization identified packages minimizing electricity usage intensity and life cycle costs over 25 years. Results indicate that integrating thermal modeling, economic analysis, and optimization identifies synergistic retrofits and photovoltaic sizing configurations reducing consumption by over 45 MWh/yr while improving net present value by more than $170,000 relative to baseline performance without increased investment. Notably, Case 5 achieved 48.6 kWh/m2.yr intensity and $412,978 net present value, reductions of 11% and a 4% increase, respectively, versus the baseline. Occupancy and HVAC emerged as impactful factors highlighting operational adjustment benefits. Findings support deep retrofits coordinated with on-site renewables as a pathway to cost-effectively decarbonize building stocks. © 2023},

	abstract = {Roofs significantly impact urban microclimates and indoor environments. However, selecting a suitable roof typology is complex due to environmental, social, and economic issues. This study aims to propose a method that comprises four parameters to support the selection of the most sustainable roof typology: life cycle energy assessment, urban heat island, life cycle cost analysis and thermal comfort. A top-floor flat in a multifamily residential building model with conventional (fibre cement), cool and green roofs, with and without thermal insulation, was used as a case study. The Brazilian climatic contexts of Florianópolis, Curitiba, and Brasília were considered. Computer simulations on EnergyPlus and data from the literature, technical specifications, a Brazilian database for quantifying materials and services and market prices were used to assess the roof typologies’ performance in each parameter. A questionnaire was applied to a panel of building experts to define the relative importance of each parameter. A multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method combining Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used to weigh the parameters and select the most energy-sustainable roof alternative for each climatic context. The cool roof was the most sustainable in Florianópolis and Brasília, whereas the green roof was in Curitiba. Conventional roofs performed worst in all cities due to lower environmental and social efficiency. The method proposed herein offers valuable guidance for selecting energy-sustainable roofs and urban planning strategies, with adaptability to other roof typologies and countries, enabling tailored roof solutions for local conditions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

The present study aims to evaluate different options for the design of low-income housing in Brazil by integrating the life cycle assessment (LCA) into the decision-making process. To achieve this objective, three single-family projects with different construction systems were selected and analyzed. The most sustainable design was selected through the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The considered parameters, which were obtained through a survey with professionals and customers, included cost, environmental impact, thermal comfort, construction time, and cultural acceptance. LCA and life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) were performed with the frontier’s system considering the cradle-to-gate cycle, which included the extraction of raw materials, manufacture of building materials, and housing construction. The projects were modelled using Autodesk Revit software with the Tally application for LCA evaluation. The results indicated that light steel frame houses present a better behavior than other conventional alternatives, and the integration of building information modelling with LCA and LCCA in the design phase can lead to the development of more sustainable houses. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The impacts of civil construction are widely recognized and justify the transition from a linear to a circular economy. Furthermore, with building users increasingly demanding greater adaptability, strategies such as modularity and flexibility to adapt to changing uses are being discussed. Modular wall panels allow quick installation and have the potential for disassembly, refurbishment, reuse, and recycling. We evaluate a modular steel panel system in two Brazilian case studies through life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle cost (LCC), and building circularity index (BCI). The study applies the circular reuse and remanufacture, recycling, and life extension strategies for internal and external walls. For the external panel, the life extension strategy (SE02) stands out positively in all impact categories, with the lowest environmental impact and costs. However, the SE02′s BCI does not have the best result. The second best option is reuse (SE03), with the highest percentage of circularity. Furthermore, the differences between SE02 and SE03 are reduced in several impact categories, and the sensitivity analysis (transport, damage, and the number of reuses) shows that the differences could be even smaller. For the internal panel, life extension (SI02) and reuse (SI03) scenarios are the best options. Recycling (SI04) has the highest environmental impact and the best potential for circularity. BCI communication must be aligned with LCA and LCC, such that an increase in circularity is accompanied by a decrease in environmental impacts or with infeasible costs, especially for developing countries. © 2024},

More specifically, the research group bio-based concretes produced low carbon bio-concretes using plant based aggregates such as wood shavings, rice husk and bamboo particles. This paper aims at presenting the main experimental results of the bamboo bio-concretes development and characterization from 2016 to 2024. In addition to that, the life cycle assessment conducted on some bamboo bio-concretes was also presented.

Therefore, information about the abundance, distribution, and biology of bird populations are necessary for preservation of such ecosystems. In this work, we studied the dynamic population of birds at Baixio do Arrozal, Trapandé Bay, Cananéia Estuary on the southern coast of São Paulo state, Brazil. As an original hypothesis, we expected that the species abundances would display differences across months and seasons. Using the point count method, bird data were collected monthly between April and December 2013. For comparing the assemblages, a bar chart of the total abundance as a function of the monthly frequency was used along with boxplot graph of this index as a function of the seasons. We also investigated variations in the abundance of some specific bird populations. The results obtained for the total abundance indicated a seasonal pattern, peaking during the warmer months. The population analyses showed a greater abundance occurring in spring/summer, and a decrease of resident species populations in the winter. Migratory birds were recorded in the autumn and spring, following the migratory movements. This demonstrated that bird assemblages varied according to seasons due to the life cycle and the population sizes. Therefore, Baixio do Arrozal is an important environment for avifauna, which use the area throughout the year and need to be preserved. © 2022 The authors.},

Archaeological fish sagittae otoliths of M. furnieri recovered from Brazilian shell mounds (5820‒4980 cal BP) were analysed and compared with those of modern specimens. Otolith Sr/Ca analysis indicated that off southeastern Brazil, M. furnieri shifted from freshwater/brackish in archaeological specimens to brackish/marine in modern times. Regular core-to-edge Sr/Ca oscillations suggest that both modern and archaeological M. furnieri are resident estuarine fish that also use the marine waters adjacent to the coastal zone. Based on analyses of a wide range of otolith edge Sr/Ca values measured in archaeological samples, pre-colonial fishing activities in the coastal regions of Guanabara Bay occurred throughout the year. This study reinforces the importance of M. furnieri as a precolonial fishing resource in this area and demonstrates a shift in fishing practices, where smaller fish are targetted within the bay and larger fish are caught beyond the bay. These data may also be indicative of a shift in the life cycle of this species, possibly caused by the overfishing of this important resource and significant increase in human activities in protected coastal waters in modern times. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Urban analyses demand simplifications that balance modelling level of detail and scope broadness. Thus, classification by archetypes is a promising methodological approach. Such an approach is common for energy studies but rarely applied for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) purposes. When archetypes are used in urban LCA, they generally result from previous studies for classification and characterization according to parameters that directly affect the operational energy performance of buildings. This paper tackles two research questions: i) Is it appropriate to aggregate building stocks based on operational energy (OE) variables when life cycle impacts are investigated? ii) When integrated LCA (OE + embodied impacts) is pursued, would variables describing both interests simultaneously result in better representation than using operational energy-based clustering to predict embodied impacts and vice versa? Thus, we aim to confirm that, combining variables that govern OE and embodied impacts offers a better result than using OE to predict materials groupings, even if some adherence is lost relatively to single-objective clustering. Clustering experiments were carried out for the campus of the University of Campinas, Brazil. After unsupervised k-medoid (PAM) grouping, the data were submitted to a supervised learning (neural networks) classification method. Generated confusion matrices demonstrate how adherent the clustering is when considering one interest to predict the other in three situations. Results indicate that an operational energy-driven archetype fails to represent buildings from the embodied impacts viewpoint, and that merging operational energy and embodied impact variables would better support integrated life cycle impact predictions. © 2022 The Author(s).},

The method is based on the computational tool Aquacycle and a case study applied in a city in Brazil. Some modifications have been made to Aquacycle, including using urban drainage and sewage structures commonly applied in Brazil and parameters closer to the Brazilian reality. Such structures are decentralized wastewater treatment systems, deep tubular wells, irregular urban networks, and covered tanks for storing rainwater. Also, an automatic rainwater harvesting system was considered for flood mitigation. The water balance proposed may also be used for a modular assessment approach in urban water systems, aiming to facilitate the application of life-cycle assessment. A case study also aimed to assess alternative water supply in buildings, including scenarios with and without rainwater harvesting. The most significant positive impacts of using rainwater in buildings were a decrease of almost 6% in stormwater runoff and a decrease of water consumption by around 30%. There is a substantial waste of water in the distribution process, which, although it favors groundwater recharge, can have a high impact when considering energy and chemical products consumption. All contributions obtained via modeling can be used to provide specific fluxes in each component that can be used for technical, financial, or environmental evaluations, such as life-cycle approaches, carbon footprint, and cost-benefit assessment. © 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The analysis was based on performed in Stata 14.1. Results: the prevalence of notification of sexual violence was 13.2% (CI95%: 12.8–13.5). Most victims were women (PR: 3.38), aged between 0 and 9 years (PR: 19), with a higher prevalence in people without disabilities or disorders (PR: 1.18) and residents of urban/periurban area (PR: 1.15). Men were the most frequent aggressors (PR: 13.79), with the most prevalent cases being reported by people unknown to the victim (PR: 6.01). The occurrence was 78% more reported at home and committed by an aggressor (PR:1.19). Most cases were repeated (PR:1.13). Conclusions: the notification of sexual violence in Espírito Santo was high and evidenced the vulnerability of some groups, as well as the profile of the perpetrators. It is necessary to work on training professionals in the areas of health and education in relation to the identification of cases of sexual violence, mainly due to the significant involvement of children and adolescents. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The potential of biomass growth, such as from bamboo leaves, as a source of electricity provides an optimistic scenario for the sustainable development of new green building materials. To validate robust life cycle inventory (LCI) data for incoming high-quality silica sources for cementitious materials, a consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) on the bamboo leaves ash (BLA) with a prospective approach was conducted. The LCI data was collected in Southeastern Brazil with a prospective maturity in biomass electricity system. The data was gathered by analyzing the various stages involved in the production of BLA, including bamboo cultivation, leaf collection, cogeneration, raw BLA beneficiation, and its impact on cement and electricity marginal production systems. According to the multifunctionality solution, the environmental impacts results of CLCA were discussed using a sensibility analysis with two attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) scenarios as allocation and “zero environmental load” (considering BLA as residue). The scenarios demonstrate the potential for sustainable use of BLA, especially for its impact on climate change, including the biogenic carbon category. Also, consequences such as avoiding BLA landfilling and increasing the potential for bamboo agricultural holdings to become energy independent was included in the study conclusion. While these results are positive, the prospect of maturing electricity production requires the development of other high-quality materials, such as sugarcane bagasse ash, sugarcane leaf ash and rice husk ash. However, the positives consequences did not overcome the negative impacts from the transportation of BLA into its system boundaries, once the highway transport model is the manly in the Brazilian context. Hence, this study provides important and reproducible pathways for developing LCI data on other biomass ashes, assisting future studies on green building materials. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Tunga spp. are fleas commonly found in impoverished tropical regions. In Vila Juerana, a tourist community in Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil, where tungiasis is endemic, dogs are the main host of fleas during their life cycle. However, there is no information about the role of cats and chickens in tungiasis in the village. Of the 272 households investigated, 112 had domestic animals, 48 had only dogs, 28 had only cats, and nine had only chickens. Of the 27 households with cohabitation among species, 16 had cats and dogs, eight had chickens and dogs, and three had dogs, cats, and chickens. The injuries due to tungiasis were ranked according to the Fortaleza classification, considering stages I, II, and III as viable lesions. The paws/feet of 71/111 (63.9%) cats and 173/439 (39.4%) chickens were inspected. Dogs that lived with positive cats and chickens also were inspected. Among the 38% (27/7; 95% IC 26.74–49.32) positive cats, 16 cohabited houses with infected dogs but none lived with positive chickens. Of the chickens, 2.3% (4/173; 95% IC 0.07–4.5) had lesions caused by tungiasis. In each household where a cat was infected, the dog was also positive. Two chickens cohabited with an infected dog and the other two did not coexist with other species. Cohabitation with infected dogs and the absence of house confinement restrictions in Vila Juerana make cats important carriers that spread tungiasis in this community. Chickens had a low frequency of tungiasis lesions despite living in proximity to infected dogs and cats. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The environmental assessment of urban water systems through life cycle analysis can be facilitated by using a modular approach. This study aimed to use such an approach to assess the impact of implementing rainwater harvesting systems in buildings in the urban environment during their lifespan, from manufacture to disposal. For this purpose, urban systems were divided into components (water treatment plant, potable water distribution, consumer water use, wastewater collection and wastewater treatment plant). The impacts were quantified using the ReCiPe 2016 H impact assessment method, which considers eighteen impact categories. A case study was carried out in the Belém river basin in central Curitiba, southern Brazil, to validate the method. The results showed a reduction of environmental impacts of up to 23.0 % on water treatment plants, up to 19.0 % on potable water distribution and up to 11.3 % on wastewater treatment plants with the implementation of rainwater harvesting systems. The consumer component was the most significant contributor in eight and seven impact categories in the scenarios with and without rainwater harvesting, respectively. Despite the increased infrastructure materials, the results showed potential for environmental impact reduction with rainwater harvesting, mainly in urban water systems' operation process (energy and chemicals consumption). By analysing the total impacts, implementing rainwater harvesting reduced the impacts in eleven out of eighteen impact categories analysed (up to 11.0 % reduction). The principal reductions occurred in ozone depletion, ionising radiation and water use. Finally, the modular life cycle assessment approach proved to be a comprehensive analysis, which can aid in the analysis and decision-making for different scenarios. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to assess greenhouse gases’ (GHG) emissions in the life cycle of wood bio-concretes (WBC) production when recycled wood shavings (WS) are used as a circular economy (CE) strategy. Two WBC were evaluated, one with a higher content of WS (WBC[sbnd]HC) and another with a lower content (WBC-LC). Different WS recycling and transportation scenarios were evaluated. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was used, considering a cradle-to-gate scope, comparing two methods for calculation of GHG emissions: IPCC GWP100 and GWPbio. The transport analysis was carried out considering the WBC production in 26 Brazilian cities, according to different locations where waste WS are generated. In order to increase the robustness of the study, a sensitivity analysis was performed for: types of WS allocation, the origin of WS (waste x virgin materials), transportation efficiency, and electricity grid matrix. We verified that the waste WS content increase in WBC resulted in climate change mitigation for all cases and scenarios (when the biogenic carbon is considered). However, this benefit can vary according to WS availability and transport efficiency. Therefore, transportation must deserve special attention for the CE evaluation. When the GWPbio method is used and CO2 capture during the eucalypt growth is accounted for, the GHG emissions of WBC production can be very low (15 kgCO2-eq/m³). We conclude that recycling wood waste to use in WBC can be considered a good CO2 sink and a pathway for the low-carbon and circular construction industry. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes to investigate the Brazilian building simulation market landscape and analyzes the possible adherence of the ASHRAE Standard 209 guidelines to the national context, especially for the compliance of ASHRAE's standard to the most used certification, labeling, and normative processes in Brazil. To accomplish these goals, two surveys were carried among building simulation practitioners, as well as among companies that request building simulation services in their projects. The purpose of such surveys was to evaluate how the simulation tools were applied in the Brazilian market, especially what kind of analysis was employed, to what end, and in what design phase according to the ASHRAE's 209 guidelines. Furthermore, an evaluation of the survey's results evaluation was carried out to serve as a roadmap to the draft of a national standard for building simulation applications like the ASHRAE 209. The results show that building simulation is mainly used for thermal and energy evaluation in the schematic design of construction documentation. It could be argued that certification, labeling, and normative processes have driven this trend, as they are indicated to be the company's main concern. Additionally, there are signs of implementation of building performance simulation in earlier phases, however, they seem to be more focused on the evaluation of active systems and envelope materials. These aspects highlight the importance of a common guideline to standardize the practice and foster best practices to all phases, earlier and after executive stages, in the same way as the ASHRAE 209. The dissemination of this analysis and the proposed standard may also contribute to making companies aware of the advantages of using computer simulation during the design process and throughout the building's life cycle. Furthermore, the emphasis on thermal and energy analysis draws attention to the need for a more comprehensive approach that can include other sorts of analysis, such as daylight, air quality, microclimate, acoustics, passive bioclimatic solutions, and others in the same framework and workflow. © International Building Performance Simulation Association, 2022},

	abstract = {The building of the Republican Museum “Convenção de Itu” (MRCI) comprises a two-story structure with origins dating back to the early 19th century. From a residential mansion to a Museum representing the establishment of the republican regime in Brazil, the building has undergone various architectural and administrative transformations. In 2021, a project was initiated for documentary, geometric, and cadastral surveying using digital tools, with the aim of producing Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) documentation and developing a Digital Twin for unveiling during the Museum’s Foundation Centenary in 2023. The investigative activity and comparison of documentation, information, and data related to MRCI gave rise to a digital timeline, with the objective of better comprehending architectural, urban, administrative, legislative, and heritage protection aspects of the architectural heritage, of construction techniques and materials, among others. To achieve an optimal understanding of the building’s chronology in a systematic manner, an investigative journey involving the analysis and management of diverse documents, information, and data was undertaken, incorporating methodologies and assimilating processes of documentary surveying concerning the historic building. Thus, a descriptive and updated timeline of the Republican Museum “Convenção de Itu” building was obtained, encompassing events and topics throughout the life cycle of the structure and considerations regarding the surveying, inventorying, and curation methodologies of documentation pertaining to a heritage asset, providing insights into the subject matter. © 2023, Universidade de Sao Paulo.

In this context, household food consumption constitutes a large part of society’s environmental impacts due to the production and solid waste generation stages. Hence, we focus on applying the Life Cycle Assessment to estimate Brasilia’s GHG emissions associated with household food consumption. We have used microdata from the Personal Food Consumption Analysis to address consumption patterns. The life cycle approach relies on the adaptations for Brasilia’s scenario of the inventories available in the databases of Ecoinvent 3.6 Cutoff and Agribalyse 3.0.1. Individuals’ GHG emissions results were classified according to sociodemographic groups and dietary patterns and analyzed through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results indicate that household food consumption contributes 11,062.39 t CO2e daily, averaging 5.05 kg CO2e per capita. Meat consumption accounts for the largest share of emissions (55.27%), followed by beverages (18.78%) and cereals (7.29%). The ANOVA results indicate that individuals living in houses, individuals between 45 and 54 years old, and men have a higher carbon footprint. Therefore, future analyses for potential reduction should incorporate these target groups. Regarding dietary patterns, vegan individuals contribute 3.05 kg CO2e/day, 59.00% fewer emissions than omnivorous people. The no red meat, pescatarian, and vegetarian diets also imply lower food-related GHG emissions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Despite the global economic and environmental importance of the leather industry, the specialized literature still presents an important gap in analyzing the environmental performance of the leather manufacturing process from the waste generated. This paper aims to propose an unprecedented index (Index of Leather Manufacturing- ILM) to evaluate the environmental performance of leather manufacturing processes. The development of the index combines Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a Multicriteria Decision Method (MCDM) and is oriented to consider the impact of waste on environmental health. Its estimate is based on: the calculation of the environmental potential impact of the waste; the waste quantity produced by the company over a given period; the relative geographic coverage that each waste can achieve; the assessment of the appropriateness of the disposal of waste generated by the firm. The proposed index was tested on a large Brazilian leather manufacturer. The results showed that the waste management in the company is not perfect but is well rated, and residues with the greatest environmental impact are: wetblue shavings, wetblue sawdust, and gaseous emissions from beam house operation. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The main goal of this research is the proposal of an integrated approach, considering sustainability indicators related to energy life cycle of the building, for evaluation of energy efficiency measures with adaptation to climate change in Brazilian social housing projects. A Sustainability Index in the Energy Life Cycle was proposed that includes indicators associated to environmental, energy, economic aspects and user thermal comfort. A case study applied in the city of São Paulo, considered a representative project of the sector and cases with energy efficiency adaptation measures for three climate scenarios, considering climate change. The integrated approach highlighted the importance of the initial selection of materials, considering their associated impacts as well as the thermal and energy performance of the building during its life time, and the importance of climate change for the operational phase of the building. With the Sustainability Index in the Energy Life Cycle, large reductions were obtained comparing cases with adaptation measures to current practice. Results of this research contribute to improve project's decisions with the incorporation of a holistic approach for the projects that are being produced for the housing deficit, considering better energy performance and lower resource consumption for users and the country in the long term. © 2021},

	abstract = {Water consumption and the building sector are among the top contributors to environmental impacts worldwide. Also, sustainable practices have been constantly encouraged in both sectors to mitigate water scarcity and provide resilience to cities. Thus, studies that provide an environmental assessment and discuss the decision-making process are essential for enabling the augmentation of sustainable practices. This research aims to contribute to the discussion on sustainability by conducting a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) examples. LCA is the main methodology applied to perform environmental comparisons. First, a thorough inventory was obtained from previous works with different alternatives for water management within a university building, including drainage, paving and water supply functions. The inventory contemplates alternatives using rainwater and stormwater harvesting for non-potable water supply, including pervious pavements. Such alternatives were compared with Brazil's usual water supply systems, aiming at diminishing the total environmental burden. The methodology aspects of LCA were also regarded, such as an uncertainty assessment and a quality matrix of the processes used. Midpoint and endpoint categories were also regarded with their decision-making and uncertainty analysis. The main result is the understanding of the trade-offs between the proposed systems, with a significant reduction in water stress obtained in the alternative scenarios. However, such a decrease is accompanied by a slight increase in some impact categories. Rainwater harvesting through roofs is the most environmentally friendly alternative, although the Cultural Theory parameter definition impacts on the sustainability ranking. Alternative sustainable systems for water management still need validation in terms of LCA, while decision-making for sustainable and resilient cities also requires a robust scientific basis. Thus, in conclusion, alternative systems such as SUDS were obtained to be more sustainable than conventional paving, drainage and water supply in the case study, and the understanding of different benefits found in the LCA is important to the decision-making process. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Fuel cell vehicles (FCV) have been proclaimed as a zero-tailpipe emissions alternative for passenger transportation; however, their overall environmental performance must be evaluated on a per-case basis. Although the environmental impacts (EI) of FCV have been already described in the literature, there is no evidence of comprehensive life cycle assessment studies analyzing the Brazilian case and its unique features, such as, the availability of biogenic feedstocks for hydrogen production via steam reform, high share of renewables in the electricity mix and the a novel powertrain technology based on solid-oxide fuel cells (SOFC) which could run on bioethanol. The purpose of this study was to quantify the EIs of polymer-electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC) vehicles when hydrogen is produced in Brazilian conditions for a current and a 2030 scenario. Additionally, we intended to quantify the EIs of a prospective SOFC vehicle. Considering the significant burden of hydrogen production, we further aimed to explore several pathways and feedstocks for production. We found that SOFC vehicles could become a competitive alternative for impact mitigation in 2030. Most significant impact reductions are not likely to arise from fuel cell weight reduction as its burden is low compared to other car components or fuel production. As for today, PEMFC vehicles would not be competitive for any evaluated impact category. In fact, for global warming potential (GWP), they perform as bad as gasoline-fueled conventional vehicles. Assuming a centralized hydrogen production scheme, the distribution infrastructure was not a large contributor on a per-km basis. Nevertheless, building an entire hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure could be avoided under the SOFC powertrain technology. The environmental modelling of the SOFC was bound to uncertainties due to the lack of data. For GWP, the current ICEV ethanol car is competitive even for 2030 technologies, assuming the land does not come from deforestation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {South American lithic cleavers are heavy curved artifacts distributed throughout the tropical Upper Paraná Atlantic Forest in the southeastern lowlands of the subcontinent. The most reliable stratigraphic data and associated radiocarbon dates show that they were produced from the early-middle Holocene to the late-middle Holocene boundary. The cleavers were shaped by bifacial flaking and secondarily by pressure using pebbles, and to a lesser extent, thick flakes. The most used rock for its manufacture was silicified sandstone. The classic design of these tools features a thick, bi-concave neck with expanded shoulder, and a long, triangular and tapered blade with a rounded tip, which has undergone a rejuvenation process throughout its life cycle. Although they have some morphometric variations along their distribution range, they have the same bauplan. Indeed, the geometric morphometry analysis does not show significant differences between the designs of the cleavers from the Upper Paraná River in Argentina, and the Upper Uruguay in Brazil, reflecting the existence of a shared learning lineage in both valleys. Cleavers are recognized at sites that appear to have been residential camps, but quite often they are recovered isolated and distributed in the landscape, suggesting their use in obtaining resources. A fraction of them present a gloss on their tips visible to the naked eye. The microwear analysis of cleavers shows intense modifications in the first two to four cm from the tips of their blades, showing polished areas, and systematically orientated striations which are compatible with the processing of soft and semi-hard plant tissues, especially tubers. These results place these artifacts in the discussion about the systematic exploitation and even manipulation of plants in the Atlantic Forest during the early and middle Holocene. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpouse: This study aimed to assess the influence of the presence of synanthropic flies in food preparation environments on the transmission of potentially zoonotic gastrointestinal protozoa. Methods: Flies were captured using a glass containing water, fruits, and pieces of protein. Results: Approximately 260 flies from four different species were captured: Musca domestica (76.92%; 200/260), Cochliomyia hominivorax (17.31%; 45/260), Lucilia cuprina (3.85%; 10/260), and Hydrotaea aenescens (1.92%; 5/260). Protozoa were identified through microscopic analysis after macerating these arthropods contained in their respective eppendorfs, using two techniques, namely Mini-FLOTAC® and centrifugal sedimentation with Ziehl–Neelsen staining. The analysis revealed a concerning scenario regarding the epidemiological chain of gastrointestinal protozoa in Sergipe, Northeast Brazil. The positivity rate was 26.92% (14/52) of the pools, with 100.00% (5/5) in Aracaju, 30.00% (3/10) in Nossa Senhora do Socorro, 27.27% (3/11) in Nossa Senhora da Glória, 12.50% (2/16) in Carmópolis, and 10.00% (1/10) in Nossa Senhora das Dores. Two species of protozoa were identified, namely Cryptosporidium spp. (23.08%; 12/52) and Entamoeba spp. (9.62%; 5/52). The involvement of two fly species in the maintenance of the life cycle of these protozoa was noticeable, specifically M. domestica (27.50%; 11/40) and C. hominivorax (22.22%; 2/9). Conclusions: Counties analyzed had an human development index (HDI) considered medium; however, they still faced socioeconomic problems such as absence of sanitation systems, waste accumulation in the streets, and illegal waste disposal, which could favor the proliferation of these vectors and the spread of these gastrointestinal protozoa. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

Life cycle assessment can assist the construction industry in selecting more sustainable technological alternatives. In this context, wall systems play a significant role in the environmental and economic performance of a building. This paper compares the potential energy, costs, and environmental impacts of three structural wall construction systems (ceramic, concrete, and soil-cement blocks) for standard residential housing in Southern Brazil, considering a 50-year lifespan. The highest environmental impacts are related to the use stage of all three systems. The ceramic brick system presents the highest impact in the product stage, the concrete block system in the use stage, and the soil cement brick system in the construction stage. The concrete block system presents the highest relative net present value, followed by soil cement and ceramic brick systems. The impacts for the soil-cement block system are similar to those for ceramic block, while the concrete block system is the most expensive, energy demanding, and CO2 releasing. The results demonstrate the importance of producing criteria for architectural decision-making based on scientific evidence when choosing wall systems. © 2023, College Publishing.

	abstract = {Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) is the most fatal form of Leishmania infection in dogs and is caused by L. infantum in the Americas. This parasite follows a zoonotic life cycle, raising concerns within domestic households, where dogs act as the primary reservoir of the parasite. Accurately detecting infected dogs is vital for effective epidemiological control in both canine and human populations. However, existing diagnostic methods in Brazil have limitations, particularly in detecting asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic dogs, leading to ineffective disease control. To address this challenge, we evaluated a novel recombinant antigen from L. infantum, the rLiNTPDase2. Previous studies have confirmed its high performance via ELISA, leading us to assess its suitability for a Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Assay (LFIA), which is ideal for point-of-care testing. Standardization of the assay involved testing two nitrocellulose membranes (HF135 and HF120, Millipore), three blocking protocols, and five sample dilutions (1:10, 1:20, 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160). Following the chosen conditions (HF120 membrane, 1-minute blocking protocol, and 1:80 sample dilution), we validated our assay with a sample size of 78 dogs, comprising 32 negatives and 46 positives, including symptomatic (n=23), oligosymptomatic (n=17), and asymptomatic (n=6) cases. The results revealed a sensitivity of 86.9 %, specificity of 62.5 %, and accuracy of 76.9 %, which is consistent with ELISA performance for the same samples. Compared to DPP-LVC, our assay demonstrated promising results in detecting asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic cases. This study underscores the suitability of the rLiNTPDase2 antigen for the LFIA format, suggesting its potential as a novel point-of-care diagnostic test for CVL. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Sea turtles spend most of their life cycle in foraging grounds. Research in developmental habitats is crucial to understanding individual dynamics and to support conservation strategies. One approach to gather information in foraging grounds is the use of cost-effective and non-invasive techniques that allow public participation. The present study aimed to use photographic-identification (photo-ID) to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of Chelonia mydas and Eretmochelys imbricata. Furthermore, we describe fibropapillomatosis occurrence. This work was carried out at subtropical rocky reefs of the Brazilian coast in Arraial do Cabo (22°57ʹS, 42°01ʹW), within a sustainable conservation unit. A total of 641 images were obtained through social media screening (n = 447), citizen science (n = 168), or intentional capture (n = 26) dated between 2006 and 2021. Additionally, 19 diving forms (between 2019 and 2021) were received from citizen scientists. All diving forms presented at least one turtle. Photo-ID identified 174 individuals of C. mydas, with 45 being resighted, while E. imbricata had 32 individuals, with 7 individuals resighted. The median interval between the first and last individual sighting was 1.7 years for C. mydas and 2.4 years for E. imbricata. Fibropapillomatosis was only observed in C. mydas, with a prevalence of 13.99% (20 of 143 individuals) and regression in 2 individuals (10.00%). Our results indicated that Arraial do Cabo is an important development area with individuals residing for at least 6 years. This study demonstrated that social media, along with photo-ID, can be useful to provide sea turtle estimates in a foraging ground using a non-invasive, low-cost method. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {To consider disassembly from project inception is becoming an essential part of the design process. This approach enables the reuse and recycling of materials at the end of the life cycle of buildings, reducing the need for raw materials to produce new products whilst increasing a building's flexibility during any potential reconfiguration. Above all, disassembly contributes to sustainability within the sector. Little is known however about designing for future disassembly. In general, the design phase of construction projects tends to focus efforts on constructability, with the value of disassembly only becoming apparent during the decommissioning of a building. The construction sector is unfamiliar with the disassembly approach and the comprehensive information management process, linking design and decommissioning for over 60 years. Regarding this, advances in Building Information Modelling (BIM) research offer opportunities for further developing the field of design for disassembly (DfD) in construction projects. Addressing this knowledge gap, this research explores the structuring of DfD information enabled by BIM to support integrated design decision-making in construction. This applied research project is inherently exploratory and based on design science research. DfD principles were identified through a literature review. Primary data was collected through case-study research, informing the development of an integrated DfD information model for measuring disassembly levels, restricted to the most common materials and construction systems used in Brazil. This research presents both a contribution to practice, by developing an information model structure to support DfD and integrated design, also to DfD knowledge by proposing a disassembly classification system. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Economy and parsimony in the consumption of energy resources are becoming a part of common sense in practically all countries, although the effective implementation of energy efficiency policies still has a long way to go. The energy demand for residential buildings is one of the most significant energy sinks. We focus our analysis on one of the most energy-consuming systems of residential buildings located in regions of tropical climate, which are cooling systems. We evaluate to which degree the integration of thermal energy storage (TES) and photovoltaic (PV) systems helps to approach an annual net zero energy building (NZEB) configuration, aiming to find a feasible solution in the direction of energy efficiency in buildings. To conduct the simulations, an Energy Efficiency Analysis Framework (EEAF) is proposed. A literature review unveiled a potential knowledge gap about the optimization of the ASHRAE operational modes (full storage load, load leveled, and demand limiting) for air conditioning/TES sets using PV connected to the grid. A hy-pothetical building was configured with detailed loads and occupation profiles to simulate different configurations of air conditioning associated with TES and a PV array. Using TRNSYS software, a set of scenarios was simulated, and their outputs are analyzed in a life cycle perspective using life cycle costing (LCC). The modeling and simulation of different scenarios allowed for identifying the most economic configurations from a life cycle perspective, within a safe range of operability considering the energy efficiency and consequently the sustainability aspects of the buildings. The EEAF also supports other profiles, such as those in which the occupancy of residential buildings during the day is increased due to significant changes in people’s habits, when working and studying in home office mode, for example. These changes in habits should bring a growing interest in the adoption of solar energy for real-time use in residential buildings. The results can be used as premises for the initial design or planning retrofits of buildings, aiming at the annual net zero energy balance. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Achieving the UN SD Goals requires the conservation of keystone marine species. As top predators, many sharks play a crucial role in balancing marine ecosystems; yet, they have been experiencing severe population declines. Overfishing is indisputably the main threat to shark populations, but little is known about the impact of non-extractive human pressure. This study tests the effect of varied human presence on shark behavior at an insular marine reserve. In 2020, humans were virtually absent from Fernando de Noronha (FEN), Brazil, during a 211-days lockdown period prompted by the COVID-19 pandemics. A local shark tracking program rendered nearly 280000 acoustic detections in coastal waters from 2016 through 2021. Lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris, showed a 43% increase in detection rate during the lockdown which was ascribed to the concomitant decrease in human presence. In contrast, the detection rate of tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, decreased by 67% during the lockdown, but this trend was likely related to seasonality in tiger shark behavior. After the lockdown, both species’ detection rates tended to return to previous levels. Further, lemon sharks increased diurnal coastal residency and made more use of areas less restrictive to human use during the lockdown, whilst tiger sharks increased nocturnal coastal residency during and after the lockdown period. Contrasting trends might relate with lemon sharks completing their life cycle in FEN and tiger sharks being migrants arriving to FEN at older ages and being less exposed to local anthropogenic stimuli across ontogeny. This study demonstrates that non-extractive human disturbance can induce significant changes in the way marine predators explore crucial habitats for accomplishing trophic, reproductive, and ontogenetic functions. Ascertaining the ecological impacts of marine-based human development should thus consider cryptic responses by keystone megafauna to the anthropogenic landscape produced by an ever-growing coastal population. The designation of human exclusion marine areas could emerge as the single solution to endow shark populations with suitable habitats for optimizing their resilience to human pressure. © 2023 The Author},

	abstract = {Sustainable sanitation solutions are necessary for promoting public health and environmental security. In this study, on-site domestic wastewater treatment (WWT) systems used for households in rural and peri-urban areas of Brazil were compared in different scenarios from a life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective. The evaluated scenarios represented different practices in wastewater management, such as direct discharge into the soil, rudimentary treatment, septic tank, public sewerage system, and source separation of wastewater streams for water, nutrient, and organic matter recovery. The WWT technologies considered in the proposed scenarios of source-separated wastewater streams were as follows: an evapotranspiration tank (TEvap) and composting toilet for blackwater, a modified constructed wetland (EvaTAC) for greywater, and a storage tank for urine. LCA was performed in this study according to the ISO standards to assess the environmental impacts at both midpoint and endpoint levels. The results show that on-site source-separated wastewater treatment systems with resource recovery result in significant reductions in environmental impacts compared to scenarios with precarious conditions or ‘end-of-pipe’ solutions. For example, regarding the human health damage category, the scenarios involving resource recovery, including systems such as EvaTAC, TEvap, composting toilet, and urine storage tank, demonstrate significantly lower values (−0.0117 to −0.0115 DALY) compared to scenarios with rudimentary cesspits and septic tanks (0.0003 to 0.001 DALY). We conclude that the focus should be beyond mere pollution aspects and instead concentrate on the benefits of the co-products, which are: avoiding the extraction and consumption of valuable and increasingly scarce raw materials, such as potable water, and production of synthetic fertilizer. Furthermore, it is highly recommended that an LCA of sanitation systems synergistically integrates the WWT process, the constructive aspects, and the resource recovery potential. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This study aims to assess the environmental impacts of different construction systems employed in a single-story low-income housing development utilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The LCA was applied to the roof, wall, coating, and floor systems, considering the initial and recurring impacts from extraction to material replacement. Data were quantified using the CML 2001 method with OpenLCA 1.9 software. The analyzed impact categories are the potential for the depletion of abiotic resources—non-fossil (ADP); potential for the depletion of abiotic resources—fossil (ADP f); soil and water acidification potential (AP); eutrophication potential (EP); global warming potential—100 (GWP); stratospheric ozone layer depletion potential (ODP); and photochemical oxidation potential (POCP). The results highlight the impacts related to the maintenance and replacement of materials as the most significant, with walls being the system with the highest concentration of impacts, presenting the highest results among five of the seven categories. In the GWP category, the wall system resulted in 42% of total impacts (initial + recurring impacts). These findings show that the selection and definition of construction materials in the design phase can either mitigate or exacerbate environmental burdens. Therefore, this research contribution lies in pinpointing the environmental impacts of each construction system of low-income housing to support architects and engineers in addressing environmental impacts when making project decisions. © 2024 by the authors.},

The assessment was carried out using the Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the payback. NPV has not proved to be profitable to efficiency strategies in three scenarios. The only scenario with positive NPV was the scenario in which the interest rate is low and the increase in energy is high. In the case of the photovoltaic system, only one scenario did not demonstrate viability, the scenario with high-interest rates, and a low increase in the price of energy. The same applies to the IRR. With this research it is concluded that, when treated as competitors from the financial point of view, the photovoltaic system presents a better performance in the indicators, being the most convenient for isolated application. Answering the question raised and showing the possibility of cost benefit for a massive implementation of renewable, financially viable clean energy. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Given a building's extended lifespan, Dynamic Life Cycle Assessment (DLCA) has become essential for accurately quantifying its operational energy impacts. However, developing a Dynamic Life Cycle Inventory (DLCI) for buildings presents substantial challenges, particularly in data selection, abstraction, and future energy flow projections. This study introduces an integrated approach to DLCI, incorporating multiple construction techniques, cooling operation patterns, and climate change projections. A parametric simulation was conducted in EnergyPlus™, evaluating 432 variations in construction parameters in a Brazilian social housing unit, including different roof, wall, and window materials, and spatial orientation. Five cooling operation scenarios were defined, ranging from split-off (0 h/day) to continuous operation (24 h/day). The resulting energy consumption dataset was used to train an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), while a linear regression model projected external temperature over the next 50 years. The trained ANN then estimated future building energy consumption, incorporating projected climate conditions. The findings indicate that, in the continuous cooling operation scenario (24 h/day), the total electricity consumption for artificial cooling may reach 18,000 kWh/m2 over the building's lifetime, underscoring the long-term energy demand in Brazilian social housing. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis revealed that each 1 °C rise in external temperature leads to an approximately 8 % increase in cooling energy consumption, reinforcing the need for adaptive design strategies to mitigate future energy demands. The proposed approach provides a scalable and data-driven framework for building energy forecasting, offering valuable insights for sustainable design and climate policy development, particularly in social housing contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.},

This article examines primary retrospective data on residential mobility collected in the Metropolitan Region of Grande Vitória (Brazil) in 2022. Our objective is to understand the trajectory of residential mobility and its relationship with family dynamics in households located in metropolitan expansion areas that experience varying levels of vulnerability to poverty. While home ownership is the primary reason for residential mobility, family events also play a significant role, closely linked to the stages of the family life cycle and the life transitions of its members. The results indicate that family dynamics influence all stages of residential mobility. Furthermore, the type of household arrangement affects the likelihood of relocation through home ownership, particularly for populations most at risk of poverty. © 2024, Associacao Brasileira de Estudos Populacionais.

	abstract = {Dwellings with inadequate envelopes tend to present higher energy consumption, consequently, higher energy costs and significant environmental impacts. However, improving performance may increase initial costs. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) are used to independently evaluate the environmental and cost implications of thermal performance. Thus, it is necessary to help designers synthesize these criteria. This article analyzes the thermal, environmental, and cost performance of a single-family house in Brazil's coldest climate zone with alternative conventional and innovative construction systems. The method has three steps: research problem identification and case study definition; criteria assessment (energy simulation, LCA, and LCC); results analysis. Investments in the building envelope can reduce 20% of energy consumption per year, 12% of Global Warming Potential emissions, and 17% of Cumulative Energy Demand. The assessment included two different scenarios of the electricity grid mix. The scenario with cleaner energy had a 25% reduction in the environmental impact. Thus, future potential changes in the electricity grid mix must be considered in building assessment because of the typically long building life cycle. The envelope adaptations improve environmental and thermal performance and influence the entire life cycle costs due to energy consumption. Thus, the results help in decision-making. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

This research was carried out based on an extensive fieldwork survey of painted renderings of facades in vertical buildings in the city of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, at different times (before, during and after the execution of maintenance actions). For renderings without maintenance actions, an average service life of 14 years is obtained. After maintenance actions, especially cleaning, the estimated average service life is 16 years. After maintenance, cleaning and partial repair actions, the estimated average service life is 34 years. For painted surfaces without maintenance actions, an average service life of 10 years is estimated. After cleaning actions, the estimated average service life is 11 years. After maintenance (cleaning, partial repair actions on renderings and repainting), the average service life is 15 years, until the last period of service life that precedes the end of the rendering’s life cycle. © 2023 by the authors.},

In the environmental dimension, the results showed that the ceramic masonry project had more significant environmental impacts and greater damage to human health and the availability of resources and ecosystems. In the social dimension, it was found that there are discrepancies between the salaries in the construction supply chain and that the concrete masonry project had better social characteristics than the ceramic masonry project. The economic dimension revealed that the concrete masonry project was more attractive. Relating the environmental, social, and economic dimensions’ results, through the combination of LCT and AHP, it was found that the concrete masonry project presented a combination of more sustainable characteristics than the ceramic masonry project in the majority of the results.

	abstract = {The environmental externalities of tourist accommodation are substantial, but their scientific appraisals have been far from holistic. Existing environmental impact assessment studies focus on hotel operations and exclude indirect material inputs and outputs due to data (un)availability. Important environmental ‘hotspots’ can be ignored in the result as these are often concealed in the diversity and complexity of a hotel's products and services. This study employs the method of environmental life cycle impact assessment to appraise the environmental externalities occurring through the life cycle of four popular comfort categories of hotels (hostel, budget, upmarket and luxury) in two countries of South America (Brazil and Peru). The appraisal is facilitated by the ecoinvent database (version 3.6, Allocation cut-off by classification) and the SimaPro software (version 9.1.1). The intra-sectoral and cross-country analysis reveals correlation of the environmental and carbon footprint with hotel comfort categories. The study finds that (1) treatment of solid waste generated in hotel operations; (2) construction of the hotel building; and (3) operational energy use; generate the largest footprints across all major impact categories. The contribution of (4) consumer goods, such as furniture, electric and electronic equipment, bathroom/sanitary fixtures and carpets, is also significant. The study advocates that these operational and non-operational material inputs and outputs should be accounted for in future environmental and carbon impact assessments of hotels. The study provides the first benchmarks of major embodied, indirect environmental and carbon impacts of hotels that can be used, with appropriate adjustments, in future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Data were collected through 23 semi-structured interviews with managers, engineers and directors, and content analysis was performed using NVIVO software. The resulting coding structure revealed the following categories: organizational and cultural issues, professional and knowledge issues, technological and operational issues, cost issues, BIM specific issues, design issues, data issues, and information and communication issues. The findings highlighted the most significant challenge as the lack of BIM knowledge or expertise. Additionally, an important enabler in the design phase is the accuracy of data provided by BIM, which enhances project management analysis.

	abstract = {Lutzomyia intermedia (Diptera: Psychodidae) features as one of the main vectors that are involved in the transmission of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in the Neotropical region. However, genetic studies involving this taxon are still incipient and important for understanding the level of variability of different populations, their role, and implications as vectors. The aim of this study was to determine the level of genetic diversity of L. intermedia present in the Ribeira River Valley, an area of ACL transmission in the state of Paraná, Brazil, through the Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Two municipalities were chosen to collect sand flies: Cerro Azul (new transmission area of the ACL) and Adrianópolis (endemic area of the ACL). The insects were captured in the house, in the peridomicile and in the wild (forest). Two of the used markers made it possible to estimate the polymorphism of the studied populations, resulting in 40 genotypes, most of them from peridomicile. The dendrogram generated by the analysis with the primer A10 showed different degrees of similarity, suggesting that there may be gene flow in the studied populations. The Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) with the A2 primer, was useful in grouping L. intermedia according to its ecological and geographical origin. There was no distinction between the lineages composing the L. intermedia complex. The results of this study, with the record of great genotypic diversity in L. intermedia, may contribute to explain the maintenance of the life cycle of Leishmania braziliensis (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in the region. © 2021, Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

	abstract = {The avian life cycle is composed by a progressive sequence of life history stages (LHS). Changes in energy expenditure and exposure to stressors at different LHS require corresponding changes in behavior, physiology, and morphology. Variation in hematological parameters, such hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L ratio), can have permissive, stimulatory, and preparative actions to help maintain homeostasis through different LHS. Few studies have examined differences in these parameters among different LHS in free-living birds, with most of them restricted to temperate zones. We collected blood samples and measured hematological parameters every week for over a year from a population of a common resident bird species in southeastern Brazil, the pale-breasted thrush Turdus leucomelas. Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration were highest during the onset of the reproduction and lowest during molt. Furthermore, H/L ratios were higher at the end of the reproduction, indicating that the breeding season could be the most stressful period of the year for this population of thrushes. There was no difference between sexes for any hematological parameter at any LHS. These results show that there is a permissive physiological effect for Hct and Hb to facilitate LHS transitions and that reproduction could be the most stressful event for this species. Lastly, these results mirror those from temperate species despite distinct environmental differences between these regions. © 2024 The Authors.

The environmental analysis uses the Life Cycle Assessment methodology to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions associated with building and operating both systems. The economic analysis confirms that the solar water heating system is viable, with a profitability rate of 29.46, which makes it an attractive investment. The accountancy of greenhouse gases confirmed the potential of the solar system to mitigate climate change, with overall annual emissions 50 times lower than the natural gas system.

Therefore, through an action research, this article was based on the analysis of the projects in relation to their requirements uncertainty and technical knowledge uncertainty and also of the life cycle of each project, associated with an evaluation of the technical and behavioral competencies of the project team, here called soft skills and hard skills. The work was carried out from July to September 2018 in an agroindustrial cooperative in southern Brazil. Among the main results, we highlight the implementation of criteria to guide appropriate ways of project management according to their respective characteristics and selection of managers for each specific project; this was possible through a structured view of the project portfolio of the company. As a contribution to this study, we provide an overview of the most appropriate management approaches for each project and structure team competency criteria, so that the project office supervisor can direct team capacity building efforts to more specific competency knowledge allowing Information Technology sector to prioritize value from project deliverables. At the end of the paper, we also propose a structural model for future studies. © 2022 Editora Mundos Sociais. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Building construction is one of the most important sectors in Brazil. According to the data from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE in Portuguese), its participation in the Gross National Product (GNP), between 2010 and 2013, were about 5% and employed about 9% of the Brazilian population. This high importance, the sector allowed new players to enter the market, increasing competitiveness. In this context, a strategy of the construction companies is to incorporate, in their management, certification systems and also, the search for sustainability, which should include the economy, equity and ecology. This article analyzes business sustainability in Building Construction (residential) in the city of João Pessoa in six major construction companies, having as variables the seven revolutions to sustainable: markets, values, transparency, life cycle technology, partnerships, timing and corporate governance. The field research (methodology) was carried out through interviews guided by a questionnaire, elaborated from the bibliographic. It can be concluded that companies that have certifications in Building Construction (residential) have a more sustainable management than those that do not have certification, because (a) they work with processes to mitigate environmental impacts, certified companies have management plans waste and non-certified companies do not have; (b) certified companies are able to maximize their profits, more effectively, through the application of transparent management; (c) there are better health and safety conditions for employees. In terms of governance and timing, all companies need to be better organized, independent of certification. It follows that certified companies seek and are closer to sustainability than non-certified. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The process to create a semantically oriented 3D model from the DSM, using the of Building Information Model technology, is a possibility to integrate historical information about the life cycle of the building to maintain and improving architectural valued building stock to its functional level and safeguarding its outstanding historical value. Our approach relies on an ontology-based system to represent the knowledge related to the building. Our work outlines a model-driven approach based on the hybrid data acquisition, its post-processing, the identification of the building' main features for the parametric modeling, and the development of an ontological map integrated with the BIM model. The methodology proposed was applied to a large-scale industrial historical building, located in Brazil.

	abstract = {Trypanosoma cruzi requires a triatomine insect vector for its life cycle, which can be complex in different enzootic scenarios, one of which is the unique transmission network in the Atlantic Forest of south-eastern Brazil. In Espírito Santo (ES) State, highly infected Triatoma vitticeps are frequently reported invading domiciles. However, triatomines were not found colonizing residences and mammals in the surrounding areas did not present T. cruzi infection. To date, the biotic and abiotic variables that modulate T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection in ES State are still unknown. The aim of this study was to identify the environmental variables that modulate their occurrence. Local thematic maps were generated for two response variables: T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The following explanatory variables were tested: climate (temperature, relative air humidity and rainfall), altitude elevation, mammalian species richness as well as soil and vegetation types. Spatiotemporal distribution patterns and correlation levels between response and explanatory variables were assessed through spatial statistics and map algebra modelling. The central and southern mesoregions presented higher T. vitticeps and T. cruzi distributions and can be considered transmission hotspots. The explanatory variables that can explain these phenomena were relative air humidity, average temperature, soil type, altitude elevation and mammalian species richness. Algebra map modelling demonstrated that central and southern mesoregions presented the environmental conditions needed for T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The consideration of environmental variables is essential for understanding the T. cruzi transmission cycle. Cartographic and statistical methodologies used in parasitology have been demonstrated to be reliable and enlightening tools that should be incorporated routinely to expand the understanding of vector-borne parasite transmission. © he Author(s), 2021.},

This paper investigates the environmental performance of mortars developed with recycled concrete from the partial building demolition of the Clementino Fraga Filho University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Life Cycle Assessment is associated with experimental data to validate the application of the residue as an alternative to cement-based mortars. Natural river sand and recycled concrete aggregates, both at a micrometer scale, are employed in the production of four different mortars of compressive strength ranging 50 MPa. The aggregates’ replacement rates defined are 15, 25, and 50% in volume. The recycled microparticles’ mineralogical composition was determined by SEM images and XRD analysis. In addition, the attached cement paste surrounding the original aggregate particle was quantified by chemical attack. Rheological and mechanical properties of the resulting mortars were assessed by the Vane spindle rheometer and uniaxial compressive strength experiments, respectively. The approach to mortars’ environmental performance considered a cradle-to-gate scope using different sensitivity analysis parameters. We demonstrated the feasibility of developing an eco-efficient mortar taking advantage of rarely applied recycled particles. Compressive strength and environmental performance (particularly, the ozone layer depletion potential and abiotic resource depletion potential categories) increased with the aggregate replacement rate. In addition, the rheological results provided relevant data, still insufficient to recycled aggregate mortars, presenting an exponential increase of yield stress with effective water to cement ratio. © 2020 by the authors.

The study aimed to analyze the profile of COVID-19 symptoms and related aspects in Brazil. The author analyzed the sample of participants from the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-COVID19) conducted in May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed with sociodemographic covariables and 11 symptoms reported by 346,181 individuals. Rao-Scott test and standardized residual analysis were used to measure the association with the pattern of health services use. Spatial scan analysis was performed to identify areas at risk of COVID-19 cases. LCA showed six classes of symptoms based on the pattern of answers by participants: (1) all the symptoms; (2) high prevalence of symptoms; (3) predominance of fever; (4) predominance of cough/sore throat; (5) mild symptoms with predominance of headache; and (6) absence of symptoms. Female sex, brown skin color, the North and Northeast regions of Brazil, and all three older age brackets showed stronger association with the class with all the symptoms (class 1). Most use of health services was also by this group of individuals, but with different profiles of use. Spatial analysis showed juxtaposition of this class with areas at greater risk of COVID-19. These finding underline the importance of investigating symptoms for the epidemiological identification of possible cases in a scenario with low population testing rates. © 2021 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

	abstract = {Coastal embayed areas are important sites for many benthic and nektonic organisms that are being increasingly threatened by habitat degradation. The knowledge on the biology of these organisms can reveal the importance of such areas for their life cycles. Furthermore, population information is also imperative to recognize the importance of these species to structure coastal ecosystems and to provide support to management strategies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the importance of a coastal embayment area for the generalist predator starfish Astropecten marginatus and Luidia senegalensis, analyzing their spatio-temporal distribution and populational parameters and evaluating whether (1) the species present a differential use of the area, (2) the species use the bay for recruitment, growth and reproduction and (3) there is an ontogenetic or gender related variation in the bay occupation. This study was carried out at Caraguatatuba Bay (SE Brazil), with monthly samples from July/03 to October/04. Although Astropecten was more abundant than Luidia, the two species had similar shifts in abundance, with peaks during cold/dry months, which are partly related to recruitment patterns. Species were distributed mainly towards the southern area of the bay, where A. marginatus had denser aggregations. Both species used the bay for recruitment, growth and reproduction. Males and females of both species occurred in similar numbers (sex ratio 1:1), except in late autumn (May-June) when females became more numerous. An annual reproductive cycle was observed for both species, with spawning occurring mainly in the rainy season, and recruitment mainly during fall/winter. Large individuals (>17 cm) of L. senegalensis were sub-represented in the bay, indicating possible adult migration to deeper areas, whereas A. marginatus had a more resident behavior. Distribution of both species correlated well with diet information previously available, with prey-partitioning suggested as a mechanism that allow their similar occupation of the area, and ontogenetic diet shifts explaining the adult migration of L. senegalensis. This highlights the relevance of feeding information to predict distribution of starfish. Our results elucidate the importance of the studied bay for the life cycle of these keystone species, elucidating species-specific vulnerabilities to coastal degradation and the importance of recognizing populational and distribution parameters in order to inform management policies. © 2019},

More than a theoretical discussion about the application of PBL in engineering learning - a subject widely discussed in the literature - this article focuses on the potentialities and difficulties present in such experience, based on its life cycle, from its idealization to its closure. The experience in question, named "Projects Laboratory", sought to take advantage of a moment of physical expansion of the University of Brasília, to integrate graduate and postgraduate students of the various engineering courses taught at the Faculty of Technology, with the objective of developing buildings for the university. In this article, we present the assembly of the experience, the formation of the teams, the role of the teachers and the difficulties faced. At the end, we discuss the factors that led to its closure and the expected changes to resume the experience in a format more compatible with the current curricular structure of the civil engineering course of UnB. © 2017, University of Minho.

	abstract = {                             In the Amazon, migratory catfishes of the genus Brachyplatystoma are apex predators that are important for fisheries and conservation. The life cycle of Brachyplatystoma platynemum Boulenger, 1898 is poorly known, although it has been hypothesized to be very similar to that of Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii Castelnau, 1855, which uses the entire length of the Amazon basin to complete its life cycle (from the Andes to the estuary). This study provides the first data on the migratory patterns of B. platynemum at the individual level using otolith microchemistry. In total, 94 individuals were sampled close to major breeding areas in the Amazon basin (78 fish from the middle and upper Madeira River and 14 fish from the upper Amazon), and their lifetime movements were assessed by measuring variations in                              87                             Sr/                             86                             Sr along transverse sections of their otoliths (ear stones), using laser ablation multi-collector mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). The migrations of B. platynemum are not as extensive as those of B. rousseauxii, and do not involve natal homing. Furthermore, the estuary is not a nursery area, at least for fish hatched in the Madeira. Nevertheless, B. platynemum migrates several thousand kilometres within the Amazon basin, with transboundary displacements between at least Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru. Current and planned hydroelectric development in the Amazon basin will severely disrupt both migration and access to breeding grounds, ultimately affecting the recruitment and population dynamics of these apex predators. The conservation of B. platynemum is crucial for the stability of the Amazonian aquatic food webs. This requires building effective fish passage on the two existing Madeira dams and considering alternative options to the large-scale hydropower development in the Amazon basin.                          © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {The relative quantification of gene expression is mainly realized through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). However, the accuracy of this technique is deeply influenced by the expression stability of the reference genes used for data normalization. Therefore, the selection of suitable reference genes for a given experimental condition is a prerequisite in gene expression studies. Dichelops melacanthus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an important phloem sap-sucking insect pest of soybean, wheat, and maize in Brazil. Most of the genetic and molecular biology studies require gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, there are no reports about reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalization in D. melacanthus. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes (nadh, sdhb, gapdh, fau, ef1a, rpl9, ube4a, gus and rps23) in different developmental stages, body parts, sex, starvation-induced stress and dsRNA exposure by RefFinder software that integrates the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt method. Our results showed that ef1a and nadh are the most stable reference genes for developmental stages, fau and rps23 for sex, ube4a and rps23 for body parts, rpl9 and fau for starvation stress, and nadh and sdhb for dsRNA exposure treatment. The reference genes selected in this work will be useful for further RT-qPCR analyses on D. melacanthus, facilitating future gene expression studies that can provide a better understanding of the developmental, physiological, and molecular processes of this important insect pest. Moreover, the knowledge gained from these studies can be helpful to design effective and sustainable pest management strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The building sector is one of the largest consumers of natural resources and energy in the world. Strategies to improve the energy efficiency are a solution to improve the performance of a building. However, in most cases, such strategies are assessed only at the operational phase of a building. The life-cycle energy analysis can be an important tool to allow choosing the best strategy. The objective of this paper is to assess the energy performance of four window shading systems in a house using life-cycle energy analysis. Life-cycle cost analysis was also used to determine not only the most energy-efficient strategy, but also the most economically feasible one. A house located in Florianópolis, southern Brazil, was evaluated based on a 63-year lifespan. The four window shadings analysed were: punctured concrete blocks, aluminium double sliding shutters, PVC roller shutters and wooden double open shutters. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate only the annual energy consumption for air-conditioning with and without the shading strategies. National and international databases were used to perform the life-cycle analysis. For the life cycle cost analysis, the cost of each strategy was obtained through a survey in local stores. The average inflation rate in the last ten years in Brazil was used to estimate the future costs. The results showed that the use of wooden double open shutters and PVC roller shutters are the most suitable solutions for window shading, both in terms of energy and costs, if they are not replaced during the lifespan of the building. This paper pointed out the need of using the proposed methodology to assure the right choice of strategies for energy efficiency in buildings. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The research and use of BIM processes and software in Brazil are incipient. This paper aims to provide a review of the scope of the Brazilian BIM literature and outlines the most important directions for future research. The work is developed based on an extensive and critical bibliographic study on journals, papers, conferences and Brazilian-authored master's and doctoral dissertations. The results show little significant Brazilian contributions in the international field and scarce BIM implementation in the Brazilian AEC industry, especially in interoperability issues, post-construction phases, and life cycle analysis.The reasons for this finding are the lack of professionals involved in the entire life cycle of buildings who have expertise in BIM tools and processes as well as the fact that teaching and research on BIM in universities and Brazilian research centers are weak compared to other countries, which shows the need for these institutions to adopt the BIM model as an essential tool for teaching engineering and architecture.},

This study evaluated the WEEE generation in a private higher education institution, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. In this study, we used data from electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) available in the university information system, which amounted 51.066 items during 17 years. The main WEEE generated by the institution was Information technology (IT) and telecommunications equipment (48.2%), followed by large household appliances (14.4%), monitoring and control instruments (13.3%), electrical and electronic tools (10.9%) and consumer equipment (9.8%). Over 414 EEE classes were identified in the institution, although, except for monitoring and control instruments, the 2 main EEEs in each class correspond to at least 50% of its categories. In addition, it was noticed that the majority of WEEE was generated by the university administration (29.3%), followed by the computer classrooms (17.3%). These two areas feature low life EEEs, while other areas like Biology and Exact Sciences, due to the high number of analytics equipment used, have EEEs with longer life cycle, resulting in smaller waste generation. All these characteristics result in a great complexity in WEEE management in higher education institutions, mostly due to the considerable diversity, increasing the recycling complexity. © 2017, ABES - Associacao Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitaria e Ambiental.

	abstract = {One of the environmental impacts that presents great concern nowadays, the green-house gases (GHG) emissions affect decision-making from both government and private sector. Within this concern is the soybean biodiesel production growing that takes place in Brazil and Rio Grande do Sul State, this last one of main producers of soybean. Based on this, GHG emissions accounting from soybean cultivation and their potential environmental impacts depend on an inventory performing that presents a reality as close as possible in relation to Rio Grande do Sul State. Thus, this work aimed to trace how the soybean cultivation has developed for 20 years at Rio Grande do Sul State (between 1992 and 2013). During this research, a soybean growing, mainly on temporary croplands, that results in a different accounting in relation to current inventories that show soybean cultivation moving forward on forests areas was found. In this case, it was verified that this work, following The Intergovernmntal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology, the land use change (LUC) occurred in only 15.4% of the area, where soybean cultivation moved forward for 20 years. Finally, this work suggests future discussion for methodologies that encompass soybean cultivation advanced over wetland areas according to what is pointed out in this study. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.},

	abstract = {Brazil is one of the largest producers of medium-density fibreboard (MDF) in the world, and also the MDF has the highest domestic consumption and production rate in the country. MDF applications are highlighted into residential and commercial furniture design and also a wide participation in the building sector. This study aimed to propose ways of improving the environmental cradle-to-gate life-cycle of one cubic meter MDF panel by means of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) study. Complying with requirements of ISO 14040 and 14,044 standards, different MDF manufacturing scenarios were modelled using Umberto® v.5.6 software and the Ecoinvent v.2.2 life-cycle inventory (LCI) database for the Brazilian context. Environmental and human health impacts were assessed by using the CML (2001) and USEtox (2008) methods. The evaluated impact categories were: acidification, global warming, ozone layer depletion, abiotic resource depletion, photochemical formation of tropospheric ozone, ecotoxicity, eutrophication and human toxicity. Results identified the following hotspots: gas consumption at the thermal plant, urea-formaldehyde resin, power consumption, wood chip consumption and wood chip transportation to the plant. The improvement scenario proposals comprised the following actions: eliminate natural gas consumption at the thermal plant, reduce electrical power consumption, reduce or replace urea-formaldehyde resin consumption, reduce wood consumption and minimize the distance to wood chip suppliers. The proposed actions were analysed to verify the influence of each action on the set of impact categories. Among the results, it can be noted that a joint action of the proposed improvements can result in a total reduction of up to 38.5% of impacts to OD, 34.4% to AD, 31.2% to ET, and 30.4% to HT. Finally, MDF was compared with particleboard production in Brazil, and additional opportunities to improve the MDF environmental profile were identified. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In Brazil, the discovery of carbonate reservoirs in the pre-salt fields has raised several engineering challenges, particularly in the oil production forecasting. Carbonate reservoirs are much stiffer than conventional reservoirs. Consequently, under certain levels of deformation, fractures can develop, reactivate and/or propagate, forming complex fracture networks. Indeed, the enhanced permeability found in pre-salt reservoirs has been directly associated with the presence of hydraulically active fractures, providing those fields with high production capacity. However, the pressure changes induced during the production phase can affect the geomechanical and hydraulic behavior of such fractures. From a geomechanical point of view, the stresses induced on the fracture surfaces can trigger processes such as opening and closure of the fractures. In turn, changes in fracture apertures can alter the flow process along and across fractures. In order to predict those phenomena, this work presents a numerical model of oil production in a naturally fractured reservoir. For such, we have implemented a methodology based on zero- thickness interface elements for explicit fracture representation in an in-house finite element simulator. In order to represent the geomechanical behavior of the fractures, Mohr-Coulomb criterion is adopted together with a traction-separation law based on the model proposed by Bandis. Parallel plate law describes the longitudinal fluid flow along the fracture. According to the results, the stress changes that develop particularly around wells can affect significantly the oil production during the lifecycle of a naturally fractured reservoir. Furthermore, these results may contribute to a better understanding of the fracture behavior and can help to optimize reservoir production and well performance.

	abstract = {The intensification of agricultural production systems demands power, supplied by agricultural machinery, besides more agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and seeds. Agricultural mechanization provides increase in the global production of food, fiber and bioenergy; and it brought economic benefits to producers, but causing larger energy consumption. Energy embodiment in agricultural machinery has been done in earlier studies, but data usually are from car industry. This study aimed to determine the energy demand and water footprint in a plant that assembles five types of agricultural machinery from a multinational manufacturer located in Piracicaba municipality in Sao Paulo state, Brazil. That plant assembled two types of sugarcane harvester, coffee harvesters, sprayers and planters. Inputs taken into account were classified as direct inputs (electricity, liquefied petroleum gas-LPG, water etc.) and depreciated inputs (infrastructure, tools etc.), regarding how they are consumed over time. Data about the physical demand were determined, providing the material flows, which were used to estimate the energy and water flows by multiplying them by their respective energy embodiment and water footprint indices. Electricity accounted for the highest share (88.9%) in the total energy demand. From depreciated inputs, buildings accounted for almost the full embodied energy, but this category had a minute participation on the total energy (<2.5%). The industrial assembling required on average 13.49 GJ of energy and 12.29 m3 of water per machine assembled. Labor’s embodied energy was very small, thus can simply be neglected from the energy analysis. The indirect water footprint related to depreciated inputs was very minor and can be neglected without affecting the final result. The direct water demand was from 5.60 to 15.70 m3 per machine compared to the average indirect water footprint of 1.2 m3. In terms of per unit mass of assembled machine, the embodied energy demand varied from 1.22 to 2.36 MJ kg-1 and the water footprint varied from 1.17 to 2.11 L kg-1. © 2019, Int.

Thus, this study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of using OSPW for cement-based building materials manufacturing, aiming to assess OSPW influence on environmental impact indicators (global warming potential, embodied energy and total impact). Altogether, 127 mixtures are analyzed, such as mortars, concretes, masonry and paving blocks. The impacts of OSPW drying and logistics are presented, as well as the impacts of the process (burning) to produce the heat-treated waste (HTOSPW). The results indicate that OSPW is a good alternative to reduce environmental impacts in the analyzed scenario (Espírito Santo (ES) state – Brazil), as a replacement for limestone filler, sand or stone dust. OSPW could be used as a cement partial replacement and presented satisfactory environmental results at high replacement levels (over 50%) in the production of self-compacting concrete, rendering and masonry mortars. The results also show that the artificial drying alternatives greatly increase the OSPW impact. Regarding the production of the mixtures, cement replacement was the approach most commonly used, causing a reduction in environmental impact indicators of 7.7 to 9.0% for each 10% of OSPW use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

The sector has been using performance measurement, specifically environmental indicators, to monitor and manage its impacts. However, managers have not been using the monitored indicators for any managerial decision because they do not have benchmarks to establish performance targets and evaluate their results. This research is an experimental study that aims to develop an equation for the prediction of environmental performance indicators based on the construction progress. For the development of the study, a database of 15 construction sites in Brazil concerning three environmental indicators (water consumption, energy consumption and construction waste generation) established by the PBQP-H (The Brazilian Program for Quality and Productivity in Habitat) was used. The developed software was written in Python language and the model was built with the use of Artificial Neural Networks. From the application of the resulting equations, managers can obtain a benchmark based on the construction progress in which the building is and promote improvements in their environmental performance as well as use such information in the planning stage. © 27th Annual Conference of the International Group for Lean Construction, IGLC 2019.

This study aims to assess existing trade-offs between the RCP and the conventional constructive system – ceramic block masonry (CBM) – in social housing deployment. Dynamic Life Cycle Carbon Assessment (cradle-to-grave), cost analysis and building thermal-energy simulations are applied in a case study for 6 Brazilian bioclimatic zones. The main findings show that the RCP has lower upfront costs, but worse performance in terms of GHG emissions and total cost (operational costs included), leading to a trade-off between social housing deployment and GHG emissions mitigation. This study provides insights for policy makers concerned with GHG emissions mitigation in the social housing sector, especially those from developing countries, where housing demand deficit is a relevant issue. © 2020},

	abstract = {Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has traditionally been considered an important water and foodborne protozoonosis with important public health considerations. Although felids play a well-established role as definitive hosts, canine epidemiological involvement in the parasite’s life cycle remains questionable and controversial. The increasing closeness of the human-dog bond, particularly seen in urban settings, has been recognized as a historically unprecedented worldwide movement. Sharing daily lives in the same households, dogs may be exposed to similar associated risks of T. gondii infection as their owners. Thus, epidemiological assessment of the intra-domiciled environment, especially among socio-economically different human populations, may provide novel information regarding the actual role of dogs in animal and human toxoplasmosis. Despite spatial approaches being recently used for other water and foodborne diseases, no study has been conducted on the simultaneous spatial seroprevalence of both human and animal IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies in urban areas of major cities. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to assess the seroprevalence and associated variables of Toxoplasma infection in owners and their domiciled dogs in Londrina, southern Brazil. Human and canine seroprevalence rates and variables associated with seroprevalence were investigated through representative random sampling among 564 households, which included 597 owners and 729 dogs. Overall, statistically significant differences between the seroprevalence of human and dog anti-T. gondii antibodies were found by Immunofluorescence Antibody Testing in 248/597 (41.54%) owners and 119/729 (16.32%) dogs. Through multiple analysis, significant concomitant variables for seropositivity of household individuals (people and dogs) were determined, including public sewer service, yard cleaning frequency, and having a dirty yard. Although no statistically significant multiple logistic model was observed among owners, univariate analysis detected associations with monthly income, soil contact, and occupation. Among dogs, the absence of other dogs and the absence of a dirty yard were concomitant significantly protective associated factors. Age differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals was significant only for human beings, with the median age of negative individuals significantly higher than positive individuals. Although no spatial clusters were identified for humans or residences, a significant cluster was identified for dogs. In conclusion, characteristics of urban toxoplasmosis may include significantly higher owner seroprevalence than their owned dogs, with canine seroprevalence directly associated with having more dogs and a dirty backyard, and spatial differences in both human and dog exposures. Although not a good indicator for human foodborne diseases, dogs may be a reliable sentinel for environmental infection. Moreover, such a holistic approach may provide crucial information for more focused prevention and monitoring programs, particularly in households with multiple pets and trash-filled backyards.

	abstract = {The Belo Monte hydropower complex located in the Xingu River is the largest run-of-the-river (ROR) hydroelectric system in the world and has one of the highest energy production capacities among dams. Its construction received significant media attention due to its potential social and environmental impacts. It is composed of two ROR reservoirs: the Xingu Reservoir (XR) in the Xingus main branch and the Intermediate Reservoir (IR), an artificial reservoir fed by waters diverted from the Xingu River with longer water residence time compared to XR. We aimed to evaluate spatiotemporal variations in CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and CO2 fluxes (FCO2) during the first 2 years after the Xingu River impoundment under the hypothesis that each reservoir has contrasting FCO2 and pCO2 as vegetation clearing reduces flooded area emissions. Time of the year had a significant influence on pCO2 with the highest average values observed during the high-water season. Spatial heterogeneity throughout the entire study area was observed for pCO2 during both low- and high-water seasons. FCO2, on the other hand, only showed significant spatial heterogeneity during the high-water period. FCO2 (0:90-0:47 and 1:08-0:62 molm2 d1 for XR and IR, respectively) and pCO2 (1647-698 and 1676-323 atm for XR and IR, respectively) measured during the high-water season were on the same order of magnitude as previous observations in other Amazonian clearwater rivers unaffected by impoundment during the same season. In contrast, during the lowwater season FCO2 (0:69-0:28 and 7:32-4:07 molm2 d1 for XR and IR, respectively) and pCO2 (839-646 and 1797-354 atm for XR and IR, respectively) in IR were an order of magnitude higher than literature FCO2 observations in clearwater rivers with naturally flowing waters. When CO2 emissions are compared between reservoirs, IR emissions were 90% higher than values from the XR during low-water season, reinforcing the clear influence of reservoir characteristics on CO2 emissions. Based on our observations in the Belo Monte hydropower complex, CO2 emissions from ROR reservoirs to the atmosphere are in the range of natural Amazonian rivers. However, the associated reservoir (IR) may exceed natural river emission rates due to the preimpounding vegetation influence. Since many reservoirs are still planned to be constructed in the Amazon and throughout the world, it is critical to evaluate the implications of reservoir traits on FCO2 over their entire life cycle in order to improve estimates of CO2 emissions per kilowatt for hydropower projects planned for tropical rivers.

The present work discusses water and wastewater minimization in the production process of a Brazilian petrochemical industry, applying mass integration via mathematical programming. This research is a case study applied in industrial scale, using data from a petrochemical plant. Alternatives for water reuse were evaluated by analyzing water consumption and wastewater generation processes by using a superstructure and a nonlinear mathematical programming model. The concentration of chemical oxygen demand in effluents was considered as a limiting factor. The alternatives found in this study could lead to total economy of 280,320 m3/y of water, and 236,520 m3/y of wastewater that would no longer be generated. This volume would sufficiently supply 4626 inhabitants for one year, considering the average water consumption per capita in Brazil, which is of 166 L per capita per day. Using this process, potential benefits could be achieved with water reuse. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Descriptive statistics of the self-inflicted injuries by gender, as well as logistic regression analysis, were performed. The evaluated characteristics were age, gender, race/skin color, education, area of residence, characteristics of the event, alcohol use and the outcome of the case. The results showed that almost 10% of the surveyed cases that were treated by emergency medical services in relation to violence were due to self-inflicted injuries: of particular note were the cases involving females and adults. Gender differences were found, including some that were related to the method chosen to commit suicide. It was not possible to evaluate some factors that are generally associated with suicide attempts because the necessary information was not within the scope of the instrument used for data collection. It was concluded that emergency medical services are very important in terms of studies regarding suicide because they are the gateway to such cases. However, given its sensitive nature, the information issued by emergency medical services is very restricted. Consequently, patients need appropriate follow-up to prevent further suicide attempts. © 2017, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva. All rights reserved.},

Triatomines of the genus Rhodnius are primarily sylvatic, nevertheless the occurrence of native species that invade households suggests their possible role in the transmission of Chagas disease. Rhodnius montenegrensis was first described in 2012, but the biological aspects of this species are still unknown. This study aimed to analyze the biological aspects of R. montenegrensis under laboratory conditions. The emergence rate was 63.0%, the mean time required for the emergence was 13.9 ± 1.7 days, the biological cycle from egg to adult phase occurred in 105.2 ± 9.2 days, the number of bloodmeals required for each nymphal stage to reach the next stage varies between a minimum of two and a maximum of seven. The weight gained after a bloodmeal varied between 10.6 times on 1st-instar nymphs and 3.9 times on 5th-instar nymphs. The adult specimens had the lowest gain of weight, reaching 2.2 times on females and 1.6 times on males. The sex ratio observed was 1:1.

	abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for high levels of energy consumption and for environmental impacts during the life cycle of a building all over the world. Therefore, sustainability has become an inherent topic in building design, in response to the stringency of natural resources and to performance. A way to design sustainable buildings is taking advantage of the available natural resources on site to reduce the needs for artificial conditioning. Requirements of performance have become more restrictive and existing buildings must conform to them. This is possible through a retrofit process which improves their performance to comply with actual requirements, besides improving the comfort of their occupants. Most of the developed procedures for retrofitting analysis take into account only energy consumption and emission of pollutants. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a procedure to help designers and decision makers on choosing the best retrofit strategy considering energy consumption, thermal comfort and the cost-benefit of these strategies. A computational model of a building located at the State University of Campinas was developed to simulate different passive strategies and the results obtained are presented in an easy-to-use chart as part of the procedure. © 2018 Potificia Universidad Catolica de Chile.

	abstract = {The growing concern about energy consumption and environmental resources has led to research on sustainable approaches in construction. Efficient buildings have been built not only to attract new investments but also to take environmental considerations into account. Zero Energy Buildings; use a variety of passive strategies for energy efficiency and to decrease the use of heating, ventilation and air conditioning. These techniques impact directly on cost benefit and energy performance. The objective of this research is to identify efficient approaches for housing, considering the influence of climate, the energy generation, for two Brazilian cities. The cities climates area classified as Af (tropical climate) and Cfb (hot and temperate). The methodological procedures were divided into three stages: simulation to determine energy consumption in the efficient building; estimation of the balance between electric demand and generation by means of a building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV); assessment of the life cycle cost of the net present value of BIPV. The results show that for the tropical climate the payback is 6.75 years and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 15.06% and for the temperate, payback is 10.25 years and IRR of 8.49%. These outcomes demonstrate that in hot climate payback happens in less time, due to the high incidence of solar radiation in the year. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Concern in relation to creating environmental protection policies is increasing, particularly with regard to the reuse of waste for power generation. In this context, biodiesel production from waste cooking oils could play an important role. Biodiesel is a biofuel that can be produced from saturated fatty raw material discarded by restaurants, such as oils and fats used for cooking processes. This paper describes a biodiesel production plant installed at Pinheira Beach in the State of Santa Catarina, southern Brazil and aims to discuss the environmental, social and economic impacts by analyzing the biodiesel production by life cycle assessment (LCA), relationship with the emission of greenhouse gases. The plant is run by an association and is aimed at promoting the recycling of waste cooking oil from restaurants and residences in the area and, at the same time, enables the continuity of artisanal fisheries in the region. The transesterification production process was used to convert waste cooking oils into biodiesel using basic catalysis in the presence of methanol. A batch system with the capacity to produce 200 L of biodiesel per day was adopted. The data obtained for the biodiesel produced at the plant were 879.2 kg m−3 density, 495.74 mg kg−1 water content, 94.38% ester content, and 1.5 mg.kg−1 sodium plus potassium. Related to the Life Cycle Assessment the results demonstrate that the category that most contributes to the emissions generated in biodiesel production process is the collection stage with 92.10% contribution, presenting a significant difference to the productions stage which contributed 7.9%. The plant provides environmental, social and economic gains for the community, for instance, increased income for the associates and fishermen, environmental education in schools, and cooking oil recycling opportunities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Potter wasps (Vespidae: Eumeninae) are known to exhibit not only sophisticated preying strategies but also a remarkable ability to manipulate clay during nest building. Due to a mixture of plasticity in building behavior and flexibility in substrate preferences during nest building, the group has been reported nesting in a variety of places, including decaying nests abandoned by termite species. Yet, evidence of wasps nesting inside senescent termite mounds is poorly reported, and to date, accounts confirming their presence inside active colonies of termites are absent. Here, we address a novel intriguing association between two species from the Brazilian Cerrado: a previously unknown potter wasp (nest invader) and a termite species (nest builder). Besides scientifically describing Montezumia termitophila sp. nov. (Vespidae: Eumeninae), named after its association with the termite Constrictotermes cyphergaster (Silvestri, 1901) (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae), we provide preliminary information about the new species' bionomics by including (a) a hypothetical life cycle based on the evidence we collected and (b) a footage showing the first interaction between a recently ecloded wasp and a group of termites. In doing so, we attempt to provoke relevant discussions in the field and, perhaps, motivate further studies with the group. Finally, we describe a solution to efficiently detect and sample termitophilous species from termite nests, an intrinsic yet challenging task of any studies dealing with such a cryptic biological system. © 2020 The Authors.

However, the environmental implications of fixtures replacement should be taken into consideration. This paper analyzes three different scenarios for the provision of water in toilets installed in a university campus. In scenarios 1 and 2, single flush and dual flush devices were installed in the toilets, respectively. In scenario 3, in addition to the installation of dual flush devices, a greywater reuse system from the lavatories was analyzed. The objective is to evaluate, through the Life Cycle Assessment, the environmental aspects related to these scenarios. The economic analysis of the three scenarios was also carried out. Measurements were taken on all plumbing fixtures installed in a building of a university campus in Southern Brazil. The research was conducted using smart meters in two periods: with single flush and dual flush devices installed in toilets. Considering the environmental impacts analyzed, scenario 3 presented lower water and energy consumption in the life cycle. Scenario 2, however, presented lower global warming potential. The net present value results were R$ 23,575.71, R$ 19,091.41, and R$ 22,500.55 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The integration of design and construction processes remains, after decades of dedicated research, a great challenge. Even considering the specific context of pre-fabrication and modularization, it was just in recent years, with increasing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) processes, that the challenge, albeit in a virtual environment, begins to be really addressed. With the advent of the Digitization phenomena in Construction, and the advances in Machine Learning techniques to cope with uncertainties of different natures in modelling real processes, it seems that the use of computational tools to simulate off-site production should be reconsidered. In this article, it is adopted an approach in viewing BIM as in a development stage to become an implementation of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) for Construction. Towards this end, it is identified the lack of representation of the entire dynamics of production processes inside BIM models. The proposition of using Petri Nets with stochastic transitions to represent and simulate those processes are presented, altogether with the use of real RFID data, to adjust the model parameters, collected from a case study with a Brazilian company that prefabricate wood-framing houses. The probability distributions are derived based on the Mixture of Gaussians algorithm, and considers parameters of the design of wall panels – so it could be used to extrapolated performance for new designs. Following the presented approach, it is expected that, with more data, the simulation process could be a good feedback to architects in evaluating the impact of its design options in production. © 2019 International Association for Automation and Robotics in Construction I.A.A.R.C.

Five design strategies were evaluated in a single-family social interest house located in three cities in Brazil: Belém, Curitiba and Florianópolis. The house was evaluated based on a 63-year lifespan. The five design strategies analysed were: white painting on the exterior walls, thermal insulation of the envelope, concrete composite slab on the roof, double glass in the windows and external window shading made of hollow concrete blocks. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate the annual energy consumption only for air-conditioning with and without the design strategies. Furthermore, the impact of climate change on heating and cooling energy demand was evaluated. Results show that not all the design strategies had a positive energy and carbon emissions balance over the life cycle of the house. Also, the different climate conditions of the three cities affected the final selection of the design strategy. This research pointed out the need of using the proposed method to assure the right selection of strategies for obtaining more sustainable buildings. Choosing design strategies based solely on the operation phase of buildings should be avoided. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.},

	abstract = {Polydora websteri belongs to a group of the Spionidae known as the Polydora complex, members of which are known for building tubes within the shells of mussels and for their ability to infest commercially valuable bivalves, which causes serious losses for malacoculture. P. websteri is a species subjected to increasing research due to the global scale at which these infestations occur. In this paper, we describe the larval development of P.cf. websteri associated with the oyster Crassostrea cf. brasiliana in a tropical region of north-east Brazil. The main structures of all stages of development were analysed and compared to other populations of P. websteri. Ovigerous capsules of P.cf. websteri were cultured in the laboratory and the larval stages were analysed until metamorphosis. Ovigerous capsules were present in all sampling intervals, indicating that this population exhibits continuous reproduction. Up to 21 capsules per tube were found, and the number of eggs per capsule varied from 20 to 40. All observed eggs developed into larvae. Larval development from egg to recruitment stage did not exceed 13 days. Metamorphosis occurred when larvae attained 17 chaetigers, at which stage important diagnostic characteristics were revealed, such as the spines on chaetiger 5. The developmental stages of P.cf. websteri larvae, and the morphological features found at each stage, are in accordance with what has been recorded for temperate populations. In our study, the planktonic stage was found to be of shorter duration than elsewhere, which might be associated with the higher temperatures at which larvae were cultured compared to previous studies. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {LCA application to whole-building studies (wbLCA) is challenged by the large number of materials, lack of production data and numerous inferences made over the building's long lifespan. Practice calls for modelling simplification, mostly through inventory reduction. Thus, this research investigates how cutoff rules influence wbLCA results of three functionally and conceptually different buildings. Three scenarios were applied: Complete LCA; mass-and-energy contribution-based cutoff, according to the European Standard EN15804:2012 and element-based cutoff, according to LEED v4 rating system (structure and envelope only). Such approach is consistent with the core & shell certification modality. SimaPro 8.5 software supported LC modelling, using Ecoinvent data adapted to the Brazilian context and CML-IA baseline and cumulative energy demand (CED) impact assessment methods. The reference service life was set as 50 years. The mass-and-energy cutoff rule preserves more inventory flows, lifecycle mass and impacts than the element-based approach. Outcomes variation ranged from 21% (Case C, passive office building) and 47% (Case A, public school building) when shifting from the contribution-based to the element-based approach. The observed patterns suggest category clustering into three groups. LEED wbLCA can be biased by focusing on categories which follow a similar trend, indeed dominated by structure and envelope elements. LEED's cutoff approach is partly consistent with core & shell certification modality and valuable to drive wbLCA into mainstream practice. Given the risk of neglecting an important portion of ecotoxicity, human toxicity and abiotic depletion, which are directly related to building systems and finishings, we recommend that LEED certification enlarges the product system to include building services and broadens scope to ensure that at least one category in each identified group is assessed.

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present and to apply a method based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) which was used to assess the environmental performance of hybrid rainwater-greywater systems in residential buildings. The method was applied in a case study in single-family residences in southern Brazil. The environmental impacts of two scenarios were compared: a house with a decentralized hybrid rainwater-greywater system and the same house with a conventional centralized water system. SimaPro software was used for environmental impact analysis and ReCiPe was used as an assessment tool. The average potential for potable water savings through the implementation of the hybrid rainwater-greywater system was 41.9%, the potential for domestic sewage reduction was 40% and the total energy consumption reduction in comparison to the conventional system scenario was 36.1%. The most significant environmental impacts in the assessment of the life cycle were related to the operational phase. The energy savings in the operation phase is essential to minimize the impacts observed and to maximize the sustainability and potential benefits. The findings of this study indicate that the scenario with hybrid rainwater-greywater system represents the most environmentally favourable option in single-family residences. The method is easy to adapt to different regions and can support designers and decision makers aiming to improve the performance of existing and new hybrid rainwater-greywater systems. It may also contribute to the recommendation of potential environmental mitigation measures and to the development of specific public policies to encourage the residential use of alternative water sources. © 2019},

The contribution of each component to the energy intensity was considered, as well the feedstock energy of the materials in final waste disposal. None of the evaluated systems were able to meet the total demand for water in a household due production limitations such as catchment area and precipitation. In all RWHS evaluated, the energy intensity was lower than municipality. Larger catchment areas increase productivity and reduce the energy intensity of the systems. Differently, increasing reservoir volume initially reduces energy intensity and reaches an optimal point around 1000–2500 L capacity.

	abstract = {The construction of even simple buildings, such as housing, consumes great amounts of nonrenewable resources throughout their service life. Generally, a building has a long life-cycle, determining the impact generated due to the production of materials and building use is only part of the problem. To predict the building elements that must be replaced over the life span of a building into a model is complicated and this step often receives less attention than expected. As a part of its use stage in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the research reported herein aims to quantify the uncertainties related to incorporating a building's replacement and repair needs into a model and defines different substitution scenarios based on international data. Inventory data uncertainty was also analyzed by comparing Global life cycle inventory with Brazilian regionalized data. One square meter of structural clay hollow brick wall was studied, with a scope encompassing a cradle-to-grave scenario, assuming a 50-year life span. Results obtained indicate the life cycle inventory choice affects the results significantly. How the service life is modeled may cause high variations the LCAs results. The use stage impact ranges from between 6% and 72%, depending on the assessed scenario, life cycle inventory, and impact category. Scenarios that applied the design life criteria generated greater impact than those based on documented service life data. Definitions about the service life used to model building elements replacement are essential to reduce uncertainties and will set the stage to refine these models, thereby improving their accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Very little is known about the association between objective indicators of socioeconomic position in childhood and adolescence and low subjective social status in adult life, after adjusting for adult socioeconomic position. We used baseline data (2008-2010) from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), a multicenter cohort study of 15,105 civil servants from six Brazilian states. Subjective social status was measured using the The MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status, which represents social hierarchy in the form of a 10-rung ladder with the top rung representing the highest subjective social status. Participants who chose the bottom four rungs in the ladder were assigned to the low subjective social status category. The following socioeconomic position indicators were investigated: childhood (maternal education), adolescence (occupational social class of the household head; participant’s occupational social class of first job; nature of occupation of household head; participant’s nature of occupation of first job), and adulthood (participant’s occupational social class, nature of occupation and education). The associations between low subjective social status and socioeconomic position were determined using multiple logistic regression, after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and socioeconomic position indicators from other stages of life. After adjustments, low socioeconomic position in childhood, adolescence and adulthood remained significantly associated with low subjective social status in adulthood with dose-response gradients. The magnitude of these associations was stronger for intra-individual than for intergenerational socioeconomic positions. Results suggest that subjective social status in adulthood is the result of a complex developmental process of acquiring socioeconomic self-perception, which is intrinsic to subjective social status and includes current and past, individual and family household experiences. © 2018, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Method: This is a comparative case study addressing a family perceived as being difficult to manage by the staff of a school health center. Household-based interviews were conducted with the instruments: Genograma, Ecomapa and Stages of the Family Life Cycle between March and April/2018, according to the Calgary Family Approach model. They were recorded in a field book, presented in a discursive way, including a survey of problems and the main interventions proposed to the family. Results: Recognition of the family context in its structure, development and functionality. It was evidenced weaknesses in family ties, conflicts between mother and daughter; relationships with social-community resources, with an emphasis on abusive alcohol consumption, the health situation of the key informant was presented as conditioning factors. The elaboration of the family therapeutic project considered the identification of possible solutions, adequate and accepted by the family. Conclusions: The presented case contributed potentially in how to guide the family approach, inferring in joint elaborations between multiprofessional team and the family.

	abstract = {Over the years, there have been numerous efforts by researchers in quantifying structural performance and damage from vibration measurements. Curves proposed by several authors try to relate acceleration spectrums to damage level, which were determined based on experimental surveys conducted on buildings. The present work investigates a vibration based criteria for bridge structures as a basis of damage and performance evaluation in existing bridges and also as a way to predict long-term performance during the initial design stage. To achieve this, a database of Brazilian bridges was analysed, whose structural design and dynamic parameters are known. For damage evaluation, a damage index based on dynamic property variation and the general structural condition, observed during detailed inspections, were taken into account. Measured vibration was subsequently assessed against the damage index and an additional reliability index to fatigue, which resulted in a clear correlation between bridge vibration and the indices. As a final result, from the observed correlations, limits of acceleration are proposed to be considered in existing and newly designed bridges to certify an acceptable long-term condition and safety against fatigue effects. A critical assessment of current Brazilian Standard (NBR-15307 2005), which estimates damage as a function of bridge vibration, was also conducted. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {Tourism transportation contributes substantially to the global carbon footprint. This contribution is predicted to enlarge, especially in ‘emerging’ tourism markets, and hence urgent carbon mitigation is necessary. Effective mitigation is determined by reliable carbon footprint assessments whose number is however limited, particularly for developing countries with growing tourism. This study applied the life cycle assessment (LCA) based method to appraise the carbon significance of various transport modes between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, the key itinerary for travel with leisure and tourism purposes by local residents and overseas visitors in Brazil. Given the envisaged rise in biofuel use in the Brazilian transportation sector, this study is unique in that it evaluated the carbon reduction potential offered by biofuel. The study demonstrated that overland public transport represents the most carbon-efficient mode of local transportation. It further highlighted the crucial role of biofuel in minimising the carbon intensity of transportation between Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Policy-making and managerial recommendations were put forward to facilitate more climate-benign local transportation practices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Brazil is among the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters and the country does not have any specific food consumption measures to achieve the promise made at COP21. The main objective of our paper is analyzing the contribution of the Brazilian diet in terms of carbon, water and ecological footprint. We collected data in the National Dietary Survey for food intake and life cycle assessment literature database to estimate the composition of the current diet in Brazil. We used independent t tests and ANOVA tests to understand the differences among sociodemographic and income characteristics related to Brazilian adults’ diet. The environmental impact related to the Brazilian diet is very high, with beef consumption contributing to the largest share. Male household heads, with medium and low income, aged between 18 and 45 years old, with intermediate or less education level, who lives in rural areas in Midwest and Northeast regions were associated with higher environmental impact. Therefore, measures related to demand have great potential to reduce the environmental impact in Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Ectoparasites are temporary or permanent skin dwellers. Megninia ginglymura (Megnin) (Analgidae) causes economic damage in commercial poultry farms as a result of lower egg production or even death of the host. Little is known about Megninia ginglymura's life cycle and infestation. This study aimed to evaluate the preference of M. ginglymura for different body regions of the host Gallus gallus L. and its abundance and population dynamics in different laying hen houses. Samples were collected from August 2013 to August 2014 in three different commercial laying hen systems: automatic production systems (A1,2,3); semiautomatic systems (S1 (free of pesticides) and S2) and free-range system (FR). Ten laying hen were sampled each laying hen house and it were collected feathers were collected from different body regions form 10 hens in each laying house. A total of 28,305 specimens belonging to M. ginglymura were collected. Higher abundance was noted in S1 (9,234), S2 (9,121), and FR (5,873) and lower in A2 (2,211), A3 (1,628), and A1 (238). The dorsum (back of the body) region showed the highest abundance, mean abundance, and prevalence, representing 29.5% of the total specimens collected. The cloacal region was the second with 21.1% of the total of this ectoparasite. The abdomen and neck represented 20.8% and 19.6%, respectively. The inner wings presented the lowest abundance, mean abundance, and prevalence in all laying hen houses (9.0% of specimens). The prevalence was significantly different in automatic, semiautomatic, and free-range systems. The population peaks seems to coincide with periods of high temperatures and precipitation. Populations of this species already exhibit resistance to synthetic chemical pesticide. © 2017 Poultry Science Association Inc.},

	abstract = {Design decisions that influence a building's environmental performance have typically focused on reducing the operational consumption. Synthetic climate data to account for climate change effects are increasingly used to predict Future building performance. Now or in the future, efficient fixtures and systems can indeed reduce operational energy, but also add embodied impacts that are often overlooked. Joint consideration of operational and embodied impacts to guide retrofit strategies for emission reduction is not yet common practice. Hence, in this paper we investigated the balance between life cycle emissions embodied in envelope retrofit alternatives and those avoided by the energy saved for a reference mixed-mode office space, in a cooling-dominated climate. Two layers of evolutionary-temporal dynamics were considered, by simulating future energy consumption and by modelling emission intensity over time, to ultimately explore how to back feed decision-making towards more resilient design in a changing climate. Window opening effective area, glazing solar heat gain, glazing thermal transmittance, wall absorptance and solar shading devices configurations were varied and simulated in EnergyPlus v.9 to define best cases for each orientation. SimaPro v.8 supported the life cycle emission inventory of Brazilian electricity and building materials usage. Changing climate effects were addressed by simulating synthetic climate files and by dynamic Life Cycle Assessment of the temporal variation in energy consumption, mix and replaced material input. The embodied GWP would equal the operational impacts after about 10-13 years (aluminium) and 4-7 years (galvanized steel) of use, according with the shading device design. The combination of retrofit strategies added comparatively little embodied impacts, whilst enabling operational emissions savings ranging between 57% (S-W) and 64% (N-E and N-W) by 2080. Nevertheless, climate change effects mitigation on the long run would still be limited, as projected annual emissions would more than triple over the same timeframe for all solar orientations. The approach herein illustrated can be generalized not only to retrofit strategies assessment, but also to guide future-proof building design to implement ultra-efficient solutions from the outcome or plan for additional interventions over time. © 2020 11th Windsor Conference: Resilient Comfort, WINDSOR 2020 - Proceedings.

Understanding fish movement patterns between these habitats is crucial for sustainable management of these resources. We aimed to identify movement patterns of the whitemouth croaker Micropogonias furnieri, an important fishery resource along the southeastern Brazilian coast, through characterization of elemental concentration profiles in otoliths.

Juveniles and adults fish from three semi-enclosed systems (two bays and one coastal lagoon) and adults from nine adjacent coastal areas were examined. Three main behavioural patterns were identified: 1) Marine Migrant, with a unique and definitive movement from the estuarine area towards the adjacent platform when adult; 2) Estuarine Visitor, with movements from the estuarine area towards the adjacent platform when adult but also performing excursions back to the estuarine areas and back again to the adjacent platform; and 3) Nearshore Resident, with occurrence in the adjacent coastal areas that are influenced by estuarine systems. Estuarine areas with large sea connections (e.g., bays) favour more frequent fish entrances and exits compared with coastal lagoons that have a narrow sea connection. The high eurioic condition and capacity related to adapting to different environmental conditions were detected in this study for M. furnieri, a likely strategy to maintain variation in life histories and successfully adapt to coastal marine systems.                          © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The environmental management of the broiler production chain should include assessments that more accurately detail the processes that occur on the farm related to the broiler life cycle. The present study meant to evaluate the environmental impact of the production process of broiler using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The life cycle inventory included all inflows and outflows of the subsystems: feed-ration production and broiler grow-out, with system boundary from the housing of the chick from one-day to the live broiler produced in the farm gate, and the functional unit of the “1-kg live weight.” The impacts categories evaluated were: Global Warming Potential in hundred years (GWP), depletion of abiotic resources (mineral elements and fossil fuels), depletion of the ozone layer, eutrophication, acidification, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, human toxicity, photochemical oxidation, and land use. The results showed that total emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) (CH4, and N2O) from the management of manure in broiler farms totaled 0.154 kg CO2-eq per kg of live weight produced. The total GWP for the broiler production process was 2.70 kg CO2-eq per kg of live weight produced. The depletion of abiotic resources (mineral elements) and depletion of abiotic resources - fossil fuels presented higher values for the feed-ration production phase. The marine aquatic ecotoxicity category and the GWP are the most impacting categories. The broiler grow-out mainly influences these categories during the production process. Results showed that broiler rearing is the sub-system within meat production that gives the highest environmental impact. However, considering the characteristics of the studied system, the level of technology applied, and the local availability of grains used in the feed ration reduces the use of energy in the transport and processing of the feed. The present study indicates the best strategies to improve the environmental performance of broiler meat production. © 2019},

Despite the fact that their electrical performances are well known, there are still some technical features to be discussed and compared. Therefore, this paper tends to show a comparative study of three low-cost lighting technologies. Laboratorial apparatus were used to measure electricity quality, electrical performance and photometric indicators. With the aid of the lumen method, the number of lamps needed to light a hypothetical apartment was evaluated. The consequent costs and environmental impacts were evaluated as well. This study finds out that LED lamps are clearly the best lighting option, considering the overall comparisons of the variables mentioned above. However, the tested LED lamp present some disadvantages as compared with the others, such as power factor, harmonic introduction and environmental impacts in manufacturing phase. Also, it was noted that there are some inconsistencies between measured lighting data and information given by manufacturers. Among the evaluated technologies, the incandescent lamp shows more measured values that are approximately the same as the values indicated by the manufacturer. © 2019},

	abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a serious public health issue in the world infecting more than 200 million people. In Maranhão state, Brazil, the disease has a high prevalence in the Baixada Maranhense microregion, where the socioeconomic conditions, high prevalence of freshwater snails, elevated incidence of human infection, and large rodent populations make the area highly conducive to the life cycle and persistence of schistosomiasis. The objective of this study was to record the perception of residents and health/public education professionals regarding this parasitosis and also understand their knowledge of the relationship between schistosomiasis and the environment. We conducted 53 interviews addressing the socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental issues surrounding schistosomiasis. It was recorded that the population believed the environment is the main cause of the disease and the fisherman may be stigmatized by their chance of having the disease. Health/public educational professionals in the region indicated that there were no regular educational campaigns, which contributed to the high rates of reinfection and the difficulties in preventing and controlling the spread of the disease. These data clearly demonstrate the need for interdisciplinary work that engages the community in gathering and disseminating knowledge and developing solutions to minimize the occurrence of this major health issue in the region.

	abstract = {Implementing practices for a circular economy transforms the way companies do business. Obtaining and processing systematized and optimized information facilitates decision making in order to innovate, create value and adopt measures to promote energy efficiency and sustainability in construction. Building Materials Passports (BMPs) are tools for inserting circular economy in buildings. They can be crucial in managing and providing information to stakeholders in industry value chains, with the aim of promoting the construction of more sustainable and resilient cities, where materials are identified in a database, removed and reused in order to maintain, recover or even increase value and useful life. This paper presents a proposal of a BMP applied to the wood frame system in Brazil, introducing the following guidelines: general information, safety, sustainability, use and operation, assembling directions, reuse and product service history. A case study was developed in a Brazilian company in order to test the application feasibility of the tool to the system. There were some barriers found in the development of the BMP regarding LCA data, as well as the end of life information of the material. This attempt to implement the BMP encourages practices of circular economy in the construction industry and, associated with the expanding use of wood frame in Brazil, contributes to flexible and renewable buildings. In addition, the main challenges for the introduction of BMP are discussed, emphasizing the need for joint action based on political initiatives and regulations that allow and facilitate circular practices in construction. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Buildings' façades play an important role in the protection of buildings and, therefore, their envelope system must comply with its function, fulfilling the performance requirements and withstanding the external environmental agents during the buildings' life cycle. Although the degradation of buildings is a natural process, there are various factors that influence their durability. The assessment of the buildings' durability and service life is a research field that brings together several knowledge areas, e.g. construction technology, building physics and meteorology. This paper intends to identify the main factors that influence the durability of adhesive ceramic external wall claddings, developing models to predict their service life that involve these variables. The service life prediction models proposed in this study are defined based on simple and multiple regression analysis, both linear and nonlinear. The proposed models are defined based on the in situ evaluation of the degradation condition of 96 ceramic claddings of residential buildings in Brasília. The methodology led to coherent results and its applicability and adequacy to predict the service life of ceramic claddings in Brasília is demonstrated. The knowledge regarding the influence of the façades' characteristics on their durability is extremely useful to designers, in order to improve the selection of a given cladding for a specific situation, and to managers and stakeholders, allowing the optimization of maintenance policies and thus increasing the sustainability of the solutions adopted during the buildings' life cycle. © 2017},

	abstract = {The objective was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of chronic back problems in Brazil and study the association between their prevalence and demographic and socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and health conditions. The study used micro-data from the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS), 2013. The epidemiological indicators were: Prevalence, time with chronic back problems, life cycle (from young adults to the elderly), limitations in activities of daily living, and mean age at onset of symptoms, according to sex and age bracket. In order to analyze inequality in chronic back problems according to socioeconomic characteristics and risk factors, a multivariate logistic regression model was used, based on life cycle stages, with the presence of chronic back problems as the dependent variable and the following independent variables: Sex, schooling, area of residence, race/color, self-rated health, types of chronic diseases, body mass index (BMI), and physical activity. Prevalence of chronic back problems in Brazil was 18.5%, and was higher in women than in men (21.1%; 95%CI: 20.2-21.9). Mean age at onset of chronic back problems was 35 years. There was an association between chronic back problems and lower schooling, poor selfrated health, and presence of the majority of the selected chronic diseases. Area of residence, BMI, age, and race/color were weakly associated or not associated with chronic back problems. Prevalence of chronic back problems stabilized at 50 years of age, but the severity of limitations increased at older ages. As in other countries, high prevalence and the impact on living conditions revealed the need for epidemiological studies on chronic back problems in Brazil. The results suggest that health promotion and the prevention of chronic back problems should be intensified, especially before 50 years of age, considering the on-going population aging in Brazil. © 2018 Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

	abstract = {Brazil, as a result of economic development and strengthening of the construction industry in recent years, is generating an increasing amount of construction and demolition waste (CDW). Hence, environmental assessment of the management systems is vital. A life cycle assessment (LCA) is presented of CDW management in a medium-sized municipality located in the southeast region of Brazil, where the impacts of leaching were not considered due to absence of consistent data. Six different proposed scenarios for the current CDW management situation have been considered. These scenarios comprised the combined use of landfilling, sorting, and recycling, and the use of CDW as paving material for landfill roads, in different percentages. Considering 0.8 ton of waste as the functional unit, the life cycle inventory was performed using primary data obtained from field survey and secondary data from the database Ecoinvent version 3.1, and from the literature. The method CML 2 baseline 2001 was used for environmental impacts evaluation. The results highlight that recycling is beneficial when efficient CDW sorting takes place at construction sites, avoiding the transport of refuse to sorting and recycling facilities, and the distance between the generation source and the recycling unit is within 30 km. Thus, our results are helpful to ensure that the decision-making processes are based on environmental and technical aspects, and not only on economic and political factors, and also provide data and support for other LCA studies on CDW. © The Author(s) 2016.},

As a further purpose, this study also tests four different wall systems. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies design science research and it presents a framework that integrates BIM and LCA. For analysis and validation, a case study features four different wall systems costs based on the Brazilian context. In the proposed framework, SimaPro8 accomplishes the LCA, while ArchiCAD 19 the modeling. Findings: The first analysis covers embodied carbon and the second covers the total cost of each m² of wall. The proposed framework performs well, and it is effective in the Brazilian context. Concerning the walls, the wood frame system is the most sustainable option within this analysis and the most financially feasible option in Brazil. Originality/value: The present study contributes to embodied carbon data analysis, ensuring that the best choice of elements and components is being used in the building project. This BIM–LCA integrated solution is valuable not only to the AEC industry and to professionals, but also to future researchers. This analysis is of great value to new ventures, since the society shows a great concern about reducing GHGs emissions. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {The consumption of poultry meat as a source of animal protein has been increasing worldwide, especially in emerging countries' economies. Due to the growing demand for this protein, we seek to evaluate the eco-efficiency of poultry production systems, namely positive pressure, dark house, and organic systems, in the South region of Brazil. To achieve the proposed objective, two methods were used: life cycle assessment and economic value added, considering the functional unit of one kg of live chicken ready for slaughter, specifically from the cradle to farm gate. The results show that most of the environmental impacts are from the production of grains for the manufacture of animal feed and, consequently, from the electric energy consumed by the equipment of the aviaries. Conventional systems show negative results for economic value added/kg, evidencing the destruction of the producers' economic value, that is, the capital invested is not remunerated proportionally to the risk assumed in the activity, with environmental impacts similar as dark house systems. Poultry produced in organic systems showed the best economic performance (economic value added/kg). However, they cause a slightly greater environmental impact than other systems. In order to minimize uncertainties regarding the results obtained, a sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were performed, identifying net operating revenue and invested capital as the variables with the greatest and least impacts on the value of economic value added/kg in all types of production systems analyzed. © 2020},

The proposed method aims to estimate the performance of a concrete structure through its permeability to carbon dioxide penetration, in order to verify its accordance to Brazilian standards. This case study is based on an inspection made in an educational building in the city of Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Through carbon dioxide penetration, non-destructive and partial destructive tests, an estimated service life design for the concrete structure was elaborated. These tests were carried out in the parking lot because there is a greater vulnerability of the structure in terms of concentration of vehicles and lack of finishing, such as mortars or paints. The tests carried out showed that the selected concrete pieces were carbonated from 2.9 to 4.4 mm deep, a situation whose prognosis suggests a superior performance in accordance with the parameters set in ABNT NBR 15575:2013. © 2020, Escola de Minas.

NDBs are a particularly important institution for channeling long-term credit in less developed financial markets. However, we argue that as countries develop their financial markets, NDBs should share this role with other local banks and specialize their focus, eventually disappearing altogether. In the Brazilian case, we show how the BNDES evolved from a purveyor of long-term credit to a more complex financial institution. The BNDES was the most important tool used by the Brazilian government as a countercyclical response to the financial crisis. For many developing countries, institutions like the BNDES may be a tenable solution for building long-term local financial institutions and markets, and developing specialized human capital. However, they also pose potential risks centered on issues of scalability, crowding out, graft and inefficiency. © 2016 The Authors},

Therefore, the most frequent solution for any building design problem adopts a structure of reinforced concrete and masonry skin and partitions. As a result, buildings are expensive and energy-intensive for being exaggeratedly solid. The dematerialization of buildings is therefore an opportune field of research. For presenting a probably decreasing demand along time, youth and adult education establishments were taken as a case study. After a decentralization policy promoted in Brazil with rapid expansion, beginning in 2000, several schools have been closed. A standard design solution adopted throughout the country was analyzed and compared to a temporary solution, developed according to the Design Science Research approach. Temporary or ephemeral buildings are better known in terms both of the durability of components and the end of life procedures, being thought for disassembling rather than demolition. A comparison in terms of energy life cycle shows that less durable buildings may be the most sustainable solution in the case of demand fluctuation, as observed in the youth and adult education in Brazil.

A study of not only the use of energy during the operation but also the associated consumption and emissions in the life cycle is required. One way to reduce life cycle energy consumption is through retrofitting existing buildings. This study analysed the energy consumption and its greenhouse gas emissions after applying five sustainable retrofit measures. For this purpose, two typical neighbourhood dwellings were chosen, located in the city of Vitória, in the state of Espírito Santo, Brazil. The analysis was conducted for the pre-operational and operational stages. Using pre-established standards, the energy of the building materials that compose the dwellings was calculated as well as the consumed operational energy. The labelling of the building envelopes was also verified, according to the simulation method specified by the Technical Quality Requirements for Energy Efficiency Levels of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R). The software programme used to calculate performance was EnergyPlus. The results indicated that adopting all retrofit measures yielded improvements in the life cycle for only one building, namely, a 15% reduction in energy consumption and a payback time of 10.4 years. Although these results are lower than those reported in some international studies, the analysis showed significant improvements in the operational stage of both buildings, in both labelling and energy consumption. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

The Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions were estimated using indexes found in the literature and calculated based on the Energy Life Cycle Assessment (ELCA). The emissions from the transport of materials to the construction site were calculated based on the driving distances between the suppliers and the building sites, taking into account the fuel consumption of the transport vehicles. The construction sites using plaster blocks for the internal masonry seals obtained an average indicator of 19.21 kgCO2/m² of constructed area compared to 33.86 kgCO2/m² from those using ceramic bricks. Construction sites using plaster blocks for internal masonry had a 43.26% reduction in GHG emissions and there was a strong correlation between costs due to the execution of activities and material emissions. © 2020 Journal of Urban and Environmental Engineering (JUEE).

These changes occur not only with the objective of increasing economic efficiency, water and energy of these demands but also with the purpose of mitigating the impacts of the supply. Water and energy crises have stimulated the combination of economic and environmental criteria in decision-making on technological methods that imply water and energy flows, but the analyzes are not always integrated. Due to the identification of economic equivalences or areas of indifference, in the long term (20 years), for some heating systems, regarding direct and indirect accounting and opportunity costs, paybacks and life cycles, in a given tropical economic environment, this study aimed at creating and applying an algorithm capable of combining the analysis of the economics of these systems with the evaluation of their ecoefficiency, in a single index, hierarchizing them, the main contribution of this study. The analysis reviewed experiments, simulations and noted the relative efficiency of systems in different solar irradiances. In descending order from the highest environmental impact to the lowest, the evaluated heating systems were allocated as: 1º) Low cost Solar Heating Systems of Vinyl Polychloride (SHS-VPC) and of Polypropylene (SHS-PP), with Index of Economicity and Eco-Efficiency (IEEr) = 50%; but, by the criterion of energy efficiency and greenhouse gas emissions, the SHS-VPC exceeds the SHS-PP; 2º) SHS Conventional, with IEEr = 36%; 4º) Solar Heat Pump Systems (SHPS), with IEEr = 24% and 5º) Air-Source Heat Pump (ASHP), with IEEr = 15%.

The present work presents a multi-objective optimization of indirect solar assisted heat pump systems for outdoor swimming pool heating. Four different configurations are reported; (air-to-water heat pump and three solar assisted heat pumps, air-to-water, water-to-water and a dual-source); and evaluated in six different locations (three location in Chile: Antofagasta, Santiago, and Concepción; and three locations in Brazil: Brazilia, São Paulo, and Florianópolis). The methodology approach configures two objectives optimization, the minimization of the Annualized Life Cycle Cost (ALCC) and the maximization of the comfort level offered by the swimming pool. The optimization scheme consists of using a combination of tools: the energy-savings potential of i-SAHP are evaluated using the TRNSYS software in combination with GenOpt; and the economic modeling and optimization are performed in the MATLAB environment, using an approximation model and variant of NSGA-II genetic algorithm for building the Pareto frontiers. The optimization results demonstrate that solar-assisted configurations present significant improvements in performance for almost all locations, reaching the same levels of comfort at lower ALCCs when compared with the ASHP configuration. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The life cycle of synanthropic flies and their behavior, allows them to serve as mechanical vectors of several pathogens. Given that flies can carry multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, this study aimed to investigate the spread of genes of antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolated from flies collected in two dairy farms in Brazil. Besides antimicrobial resistance determinants, the presence of virulence genes related to bovine colibacillosis was also assessed. Of 94 flies collected, Musca domestica was the most frequently found in the two farms. We isolated 198 E. coli strains (farm A = 135 and farm B = 63), and >30% were MDR E. coli. We found an association between blaTEM and phenotypical resistance to ampicillin, or chloramphenicol, or tetracycline; and blaCTX-M and resistance to cefoperazone. A high frequency (86%) of phylogenetic group B1 among MDR strains and the lack of association between multidrug resistance and virulence factors suggest that antimicrobial resistance possibly is associated with the commensal bacteria. Clonal relatedness of MDR E. coli performed by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis showed wide genomic diversity. Different flies can carry clones, but with distinct antimicrobial resistance pattern. Sanger sequencing showed that the same class 1 integron arrangement is displayed by apparently unrelated strains, carried by different flies. Our conjugation results indicate class 1 integron transfer associated with tetracycline resistance. We report for the first time, in Brazil, that MDR E. coli is carried by flies in the milking environment. Therefore, flies can act as carriers for MDR strains and contribute to dissemination routes of antimicrobial resistance. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Previous studies have found evidence of the importance of changes in household composition to explain land use choices in agricultural frontiers. Most of these studies, however, analyze these dynamics at later stages of the frontier development, rendering mixed evidence on the role of population drivers. This study examines the effects of household demographic composition (household life cycle) and time on property (property life cycle) on land use dynamics in small farms at Machadinho d’Oeste, Rondônia. Based on a unique dataset covering the agricultural frontier since its onset, the study analyzes these effects when their association with land cover dynamics is most likely. Data collected in 1987 and 1995 for a census survey regarding settlers on the original settlement area was used for the study. The relationship between cycles and types of land use was analyzed and modelled by means of Beta and Dirichlet regression models. A consistent relation between family labor supply and deforested stock was observed with regards to rural property. Time on the property was also associated with deforestation, although its non-linear effect suggests experimentation with the local biophysical environment. The effect of the life cycle and of the lot are self-determined in the initial stages of frontier development, indicating the relevance of the demographic dynamics of households for land use choices in agricultural frontiers. © 2017, Associacao Brasileira de Estudos Populacionais.

The potential environmental impacts were assessed by using two specific life cycle impact assessment methodologies, CML baseline (v3.03) and Impact 2002+ (v2.12). The results obtained by both methodologies highlighted the importance of the avoided impacts from recovered materials, mainly those related to steel, glass and plastics recycling. In particular, the CML baseline indicated “Human Toxicity” as the most important category, mainly due to the avoided impacts from steel recycling and the generated impacts from transportation in all the C&DW management stages. The Impact 2002+ highlighted instead the role of the categories of “Respiratory Inorganics” and “Global Warming” in accordance with the results related again to steel recycling and transportation but also to landfilling of solid residues. The study considered some alternative scenarios of the mineral fraction management, which quantified the expected advantages of increasing C&DW recycling and improving the quality of recycled aggregates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Inadequate solid waste management leads to contamination of the soil and surface and underground water; the emergence of antibiotic-resistant superbacteria due to the inadequate disposal of medicines in toilets or in household rubbish; and the emission of persistent organic pollutants, such as flame retardants, present in some electrical/electronic equipment. In Brazil, the principles that underpin the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) are consistent with those used by developed countries, namely, the polluter-payer and protector-receiver; cooperation among the different spheres of government, the business sector, and other societal segments; and the shared product life-cycle responsibility (Brasil, 2010a; Novi et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2019). In the latter, selective collection and reverse logistics systems are the primary instruments (Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, the general objective of this work is to compare the technical and economic feasibility of four different sectorial agreements for reverse logistics implemented in Brazil. The specific objective is to describe the possible conflicts of interest of the multistakeholders. The sources of evidence used in this multi-case study were interviews, observations, and documentary research in the period from 2016 to 2018. The first result demonstrated that the economic viability of reverse logistics systems are obtained when the wastes have a commercial value after consumption (packaging and consumer electronics) or when industries organize to charge a fee that covers the costs of recycling and transport (lamps and medicines). The second result shows that there are many stakeholders involved in this process: manufacturers and importers, consumers, private waste and recycling companies, and government represented by municipalities, the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), and state environmental agencies (OEMAs). Each one has different interests and responsibilities: government has to preserve the environment and comply with international agreements on climate change, thus creating laws that ultimately burden companies and cities; profit-maximizing companies evaluate these rules as additional costs in their operations, whereas cities, in which operations are conducted, have low financial and managerial capacity. The stakeholder map reveals that there are overlapping roles among agents, with some being the same for all chains, and the constructed power and level of interest matrix indicates the importance of the process to be conducted by the state to align economic and social-environmental interests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

LCA quantifies the environmental loads throughout the life cycle of an activity and is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Brazilian Association of Technical Standards (Associação Brasileira de Normas Técnicas — ABNT). LCA considered all the phases of SHW management: regular collection, selective collection, recycling, final disposal and intermediate transportation. The SimaPro software was used, with the Ecoinvent database and CML-IA baseline environmental assessment method, version 3.00/World 2000. In 2004, it was verified that selective collection included 11% of the SHW generated in the districts served by the sorting unit. The remainder (89%) was, in its majority, transported and destined for the Metropolitan Sanitary Landfill of João Pessoa. Interpretation of the LCA results for the different impact categories revealed that recycling brings positive environmental benefits when the atmospheric emissions associated with eutrophication, global warming and photochemical oxidation were considered. An overall negative value was obtained for these categories, due to recycling, in comparison with the other analyzed phases (selective collection, regular collection, consumption of energy in the sheds, sorting unit, transportation and landfilling). For atmospheric emissions associated with depletion of the ozone layer and acidification, negative emissions associated with recycling were not sufficient to produce an overall negative balance. © 2019 Associação Brasileira de Engenharia Sanitária e Ambiental.},

	abstract = {The study of consumption in the relationship between Population and Environment (P-E) has been gaining prominence and notoriety since it is being proved that this is a variable that is extremely correlated with demographic dynamics. The objective of this study is to analyze the consumption of household electricity per capita by stages of the household life cycle in Brazil and to simulate the behavior of energy consumption considering changes in the household age structure. The proposed methodology consists of measuring specific consumption rates by the phase of the household’s life cycle and, through direct standardization techniques, verifying the level of energy consumption in case Brazil had other age structures in its households. The database used in this research was the 2008/2009 Consumer Expenditure Survey. The results indicate that the level of household electricity consumption per capita presented by Brazil in 2009 would decrease by 2.6 kWh if the country had the age structure observed in 1970. As a conclusion from the results, there will likely be an increase in the consumption of electricity when the households will have a more aged structure, by the age of the head of the household. That means consumption should increase, in part, due to population aging. This research corroborates the demystification of Malthusianism, whose main idea attaches too much importance to the population volume in the environmental debate to the detriment of other demographic variables, as well as strengthens the need to create and consolidate a systematic line of research on “consumer demography”. © 2020 Universidade Federal do Parana.

	abstract = {This paper provides an overview of the main efforts that are being endeavored by Petrobras in order to contribute for developing a Brazilian regulation for use and discharge of drilling fluids and cuttings from offshore oil and gas operation, based on operational safety, well integrity and environmental aspects. In early 2018, the Brazilian Environmental Agency launched a Normative Instruction (IN 01/2018) addressing some new conditions for use and discharge of fluids and cuttings from offshore drilling rigs. This regulation is based on the EPA rules, although some relevant points deviate from it, such as the prohibition for discharging drilling fluids and cuttings associated with hydrocarbon reservoir sections. Additionally, this regulation mentions a potential zero discharge by 2022. Due to the challenges for meeting these new requirements and some uncertainty about the real environmental benefits, Petrobras has been developing fundamental and applied studies, research development and protocols in this area. Petrobras settled an innovative governance model to deal with the new regulation, its consequences and interfaces. It works as a multidisciplinary committee coordinated by an executive manager. It involves a law support for environmental issues and four work fronts, such as (1) linking between internal and external organization (2) guarantee of providing the required infrastructure (3) economical and operational impacts (4) technologies (research, development, studies and protocols) dedicated for related matters. Concerning the forth front, seven important initiatives were initially addressed and cover topics such as operational safety, well integrity - including offshore wells dedicated to cuttings disposal, laboratory protocols and environmental issues. Some relevant studies are those concerning LCA (life cycle analysis), options for avoiding landfill as final cutting disposal onshore and the quantification of oil compounds in drilling fluids and cuttings from the pay zone well section. The lack of knowledge about the whole impact for onshore destination as drilling waste management strategy, the improvements that still have to be established in order to achieve better operational practices and the comprehension of the input of oil from drilling discharges are the main drivers of this paper. The results help to clarify cloudy topics and, consequently, contribute to create a new basis for building or revisiting some aspects of the present regulation. © Copyright 2019, Offshore Technology Conference},

	abstract = {Purpose: The fair wage potential (FWP) is a social assessment method that can serve as an important measure to estimate the related social impacts along a product's life cycle; however, it does not admit a direct relation to the functional unit. This research presents the weighted fair wage potential (WFWP) method that relates the functional unit to the FWP. It is a simplified method to connect the material inventory to social data. This study aims to develop an approach to assess and choose the best construction typology for buildings based on the social sustainability of workers involved in the sectors. Design/methodology/approach: The study is presented in phases. Phase 1 selected and identified two Brazilian house projects, which were considered for the following processes: extraction of raw materials, manufacture of building materials and housing construction. Phase 2 assembled the social life cycle inventories and executed them using the social life cycle assessment (SLCA). The inventory of materials followed the functional unit: “1.0 m² of the built housing”, and the social inventory observed data extracted from the National Household Sample Survey (PNAD). The study considered the stakeholder category “worker” and analysed the impact subcategory “fair salary”. The study also divided the social data into categories: worker gender, worker race/colour, worker union and worker formality to analyse the impact of subcategories: “equal opportunities/discrimination”, “freedom of association and collective bargaining” and “social benefits/social security”. Phase 3 compared the projects according to the results from the SLCA. The FWP considers the wage paid at supply chain sectors, and the WFWP relates the functional unit to the social data. Findings: The results proved that the wages paid by the construction supply chain are fair. However, there are differences between the FWP of male and female workers, white and non-white workers, unionised and non-unionised workers and formal and informal workers. The study of the actual Brazilian minimum wage indicated that the FWP is sensitive to the reference wage to which the analysed wages paid are related. Considering the WFWP, the constructive typology employed in Project B can generate increased positive social impacts than Project A. The proposed study provides excellent results, and it can be adapted to different data to assess the social conditions of other countries and sectors. Research limitations/implications: There is not enough primary data available for the variables real wages and real working time; for this reason, these variables received secondary data. Another limitation is the data used for the year range, since Brazilian microdata do not include years before 2002 and years beyond 2015. Originality/value: The WFWP differs from the existing social sustainability studies because it relates the material information to social data; also, it defines the best option among the analysed alternatives, taking into consideration social sustainability, which enables the project design to go beyond technical aspects. The constructive typology and materials take into account the social sustainability of the construction supply chain, generating more sustainable projects and improving the circumstances of affected stakeholders. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

The objective of this article is to analyse the energy life cycle and the life cycle cost of stormwater harvesting systems using pervious pavements models in order to compare and evaluate the differences and verify what influences the profitability and sustainability. The method proposed started with the definition of pervious pavement models based on literature review. The main characteristic of the models analysed was the use of porous asphalt with different underlying layers, i.e. thickness and material. The hydrological-hydraulic design of the pavements was also assessed. The potential for potable water savings due to harvesting stormwater from a parking lot was estimated for a public building in Florianópolis, southern Brazil. The models were compared to identify what most influences the potable water savings, the profitability and the sustainability of the systems. The maximum potable water savings found were 42%. It was also observed that the overall consumption of the building has been decreasing over the years, and the yearly rainfall has increased, which leads to a higher potential. In the current water consumption pattern, none of the systems evaluated was profitable or presented sustainability, evaluated herein as negative energy balance. However, it was verified that if analysed comparatively with non-pervious pavement, it was profitable to use stormwater harvested from the pervious pavement. Thus, it can be concluded that stormwater harvesting systems in combination with pervious pavements are promising, serving as SUDS and saving money for users. It is also noticeable that the use of porous asphalt is not recommended when aiming for systems with low embedded energy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

The purpose of this study is to analyze and compare the environmental performance of particleboard production in both countries. The results showed that the greatest impacts in four impact categories correspond to Brazilian particleboards, because of the use of heavy fuel-oil and virgin wood as energy source and raw material respectively, as well as uncontrolled formaldehyde emissions. On the contrary, Spanish production reports worse results in other impacts (eutrophication and toxicity related categories) mostly due to the large demand of diesel in the mobile chipping machine. A sensitivity analysis based on the variation of scenarios considering multifunctionality issues to produce particleboards in Brazil and Spain was conducted. The allocation approach (economic and mass) showed a relevant influence for all impact categories for the Brazilian scenarios in order to reduce most of the environmental impacts, however, it has increased most of the impacts for the Spanish ones due to the change of perspective in the hypothesis that wooden residues are free of environmental burden.

	abstract = {Ecological intensification is a new concept in agriculture that addresses the double challenge of maintaining a level of production sufficient to support needs of human populations and respecting the environment in order to conserve the natural world and human quality of life. This article adapts this concept to fish farming using agroecological principles and the ecosystem services framework. The method was developed from the study of published literature and applications at four study sites chosen for their differences in production intensity: polyculture ponds in France, integrated pig and pond polyculture in Brazil, the culture of striped catfish in Indonesia and a recirculating salmon aquaculture system in France. The study of stakeholders’ perceptions of ecosystem services combined with environmental assessment through Life Cycle Assessment and Emergy accounting allowed development of an assessment tool that was used as a basis for co-building evolution scenarios. From this experience, ecological intensification of aquaculture was defined as the use of ecological processes and functions to increase productivity, strengthen ecosystem services and decrease disservices. It is based on aquaecosystem and biodiversity management and the use of local and traditional knowledge. Expected consequences for farming systems consist of greater autonomy, efficiency and better integration into their surrounding territories. Ecological intensification requires territorial governance and helps improve it from a sustainable development perspective. © 2017 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd},

	abstract = {Buildings play a central role in the low-carbon future and pose challenges for integration with sustainable development, especially in Brazil, where urban areas are still expanding and the implementation of environmental tools, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), faces more difficulties. The aim of this paper is to assess the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions during the whole life cycle of a housing complex located in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For this purpose, a life cycle-based analysis was carried out to estimate the GHG emission from the production of the most commonly used building materials, such as steel, cement, ceramic, wood, among others; transport activities; and the construction, use (energy consumption during 50-year useful life), maintenance and demolition of the housing complex. According to the results, the GHG emissions generated during the housing complex's life cycle are 282.62 tCO2eq, which can be expressed as 1,009.34 kg CO2eq./m2/50-year or 20.19 kg CO2eq./m2/year. These emissions are dominated by the use stage (56%), which is followed by the pre-use (30%) and end-of-life (14%) stages. Indirect emissions accounted for more than half of GHG emissions (57%), mainly driven by emissions from building materials (85.47 t CO2eq.; or 30%). Cement was responsible for 22% of embodied GHG emissions from building materials. These findings are relevant to the Brazilian context in which environmental issues have not determined the choice of building materials. Furthermore, this paper supports the improvement of the LCA usefulness in Brazil as it contributes to the mitigation of the lack of national datasets. © 2021 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

At that time, the constructions were in superstructure execution phase. With an area of 155,000 m2 and investment of $ 31 million, the constructions belong to Brazilian Federal Government and are destined to Federal University of Latin-American Integration (Unila) installations. It was observed that performed protection works were mainly related to exposed reinforcement protection, waterproof and protection of structures in contact with soil, and drainage services execution. The protection costs were approximately 1.4% of investment value, following the Sitter’s “Law of fives". Thus, the technical and economic importance of protective measures adoption in concrete structures that had their works interrupted is noted, so that the case study serves as a model for other buildings in same situation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon brasiliensis (Návas) (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) are predators that build traps in dry sandy soil to capture prey. Here we determined the effect of rain on trap building by M. brasiliensis larvae in a riparian forest in the Cerrado biome. Differences in population size and developmental stage were found between the rainy and dry seasons. In the laboratory, the effect of rain-soaked soil on trap building was evaluated. Fewer antlion larvae were found in the rainy season. Moreover, a greater abundance of larvae in the final stage of development (third instar) was found in the dry season, whereas more first instars were found in the rainy season. The latter revealed that wet soil affects the trap building of the larvae, as smaller traps were built in the treatment with soaked soil (simulated rain), whereas the larvae in the control treatment (no rain) continued building traps with no change in size. The findings indicate that seasonality in the Cerrado biome exerts a short-term influence on M. brasiliensis larvae (larvae build fewer traps) as well as a long-term influence (association with life cycle). © 2019 The Netherlands Entomological Society},

Four design options are simulated for the same building, including structural design as rigid frame system or hinged frame system with second order/P delta effects. In both cases buildings were designed with concrete strength class 25 MPa (C25) applied in all the structural elements or a concrete strength class range of 50 MPa to 25 MPa (C25–C50) applied in columns, varying along the building height. Environmental impacts were quantified through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) based on measurements of environmental loads of processes and products, from cradle to grave. Results show reduction of environmental impacts, embodied energy and construction costs when a decrease in the amount of steel is combined with the increase in the concrete compressive strength of columns, which is more representative for the building designed as hinged frame system. The production of materials phase showed to be the major contributor to environmental impacts with steel and concrete being the most relevant impact producers. Concrete represents important impacts for stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change while steel dominates the ecotoxicity-related indicators. Results highlight the importance of design strategies to increase the sustainability potential of a RC structure and contribute to consolidate contemporary approaches that suggest the need to incorporate the degree of environmental impacts in design methods. © 2018},

	abstract = {Uncertainties evaluation is increasingly gaining traction within life cycle assessment (LCA), due to its key role as environmental decision support tool. When applied at whole-building scale, the large variety of materials, subjective choices and long lifespans introduce parameter, scenario and model uncertainties throughout the life cycle. Since normative choices are unavoidable within whole-building LCA (wbLCA), in this article we carried out a so-called 'scenario' uncertainty assessment for one illustrative case study. First, three uncertainty sources were selected, to include the two drivers most frequently cited in literature (reference service life and end of life management alternatives) and material wastage, a relevant issue to factor in variable construction optimization levels in contexts like Brazil. Cumulative energy demand (CED) and CML 2001 v.2.05 methods were used for calculating deterministic values of non-renewable embodied energy and global warming potential in SimaPro 7.3 The uncertainty assessment combined scenario analysis, stochastic modelling (Monte Carlo simulation of triangular probability distributions for the uncertainty drivers investigated) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The GSA confirmed the dominant contribution of the operational phase - strongly influenced by components replacement rate - to of life cycle non-renewable embodied energy and global warming potential result variance, whilst construction and end of life stages showed no correlation with life cycle results. Findings from this research also highlight the strategic importance of gathering service life information adherent to the assessed context. Building components replacement rates induced by the Brazilian standard are overestimated relatively to international figures used in LCAs worldwide. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same time, improve smallholders’ livelihoods in agricultural areas. However, studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal of this paper was to assess the contribution of five biodiverse AFS, located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally, the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated; and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the negative values of GWP, ranging from (−263) to (−496) t CO2 equivalents per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits provided by the AFSs. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets to thrive. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Life cycle assessment can support decisions for improving the environmental performance of construction products. However, the amount of data required for developing life cycle inventories limits the adoption of LCA. This work associates the interpretation of the impact results of construction products at the unit process level with a quantitative definition for the foreground and background system, for guiding primary data collection towards foreground processes that can be affected by decision-makers in the construction sector. Methods: A set of construction products commonly used in Brazil is selected, and their cradle-to-gate life cycle inventories are modeled using the ecoinvent database (version 2). Life cycle impact assessment is performed using the ReCiPe Midpoint Hierarchist method. The contribution of each process during the life cycle of construction products for each impact category is quantified. These processes are associated with economic sectors, which are classified as belonging to the foreground or background system from the perspective of the construction industry. Foreground sectors are those controlled or influenced by the construction sector and are defined based on the production share consumed by the construction value chain. The elementary flows defining each impact category are also identified. Results and discussion: Foreground processes show significant contributions to most impact results of construction products. Global warming, fine particulate matter formation, ozone formation, acidification, human carcinogenic toxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity are mainly caused by direct emissions and fossil fuel combustion in manufacturing processes. Land occupation for production activities contributes to land use change, while the consumption of fuels, raw materials, and water causes fossil and mineral resource scarcity and water consumption respectively. Freshwater and marine ecotoxicities and human non-carcinogenic toxicity have foreground contributions only for steel and copper products due to emissions from the landfilling of mining tails. Ionizing radiation and stratospheric ozone depletion are mostly driven by background processes. A reduced group of elementary flows covers a big share of the environmental impacts of most construction products. Conclusions: The results indicate priorities for life cycle inventory primary data collection of construction products, by focusing on foreground processes and the corresponding elementary flows that cause many of the potential embodied impacts of construction.

	abstract = {Pine (Pinus oocarpa) wood has great economic importance in Brazil. Pine stands represent the second largest reforested area in the country due to their industrial interest. Combining the relevance of industrial pine stands in the country and corresponding environmental concerns, this current study aims to identify and quantify the environmental impacts derived from industrial pine roundwood production in Brazil. The environmental study was developed considering the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology according to ISO14040 framework. The study convers the life cycle of pine roundwood production from cradle-to-forest gate perspective and considers the current practices in the country. The production system was divided in five main stages: Soil preparation, seedlings plantation, forest management, forest harvesting and infrastructure establishment. The environmental profile was estimated considering characterization factors from the ReCiPe method, in terms of twelve impact categories. According to the results, forest harvesting stage was identified as the environmental hotspot being the main responsible of contributions to nine impact categories under assessment with contributing ratios ranging from 21% (e.g., freshwater eutrophication) to 76% (e.g., photochemical oxidants formation). The high amount of fossil fuel required by heavy machinery used in the activities involved in this stage is behind this result. Soil preparation stage reported also an outstanding contribution in categories such as freshwater eutrophication (37%) and toxicity related categories (≈35%). The rationale behind these contributions is associated with the use of chemical fertilizers, mostly superphosphate. The identification of the environmental hotspots in forest biomass production can assist the Brazilian forest practitioners to improve the environmental profile by means of the optimization of forest practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Based on the theoretical contributions brought by the New Economics of Labor Migration and Transnationalism, we investigate how three intervening factors affect household living arrangements in the migrant’s country of origin: people’s life-cycle stages, migration regimes, and family normative systems. Using as case study the municipality of Governador Valadares, Brazil, the country’s main international emigration hotspot, we draw on a mixed-methods approach that includes the analysis of the Brazilian Census and novel survey data, in addition to 20 in-depth semi-structured interviews with migrants’ relatives and returnees. The results point to clear differences between the structure of households with and without international emigrants. The reasons for these differences may be two-fold: (a) international emigration is an important factor leading to the rearrangement of family care systems, and (b) migration decision-making processes are dependent upon particular household structures, family norms and migration regimes. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The objective of this work is to present and to apply a method to environmentally evaluate a permeable pavement system used to harvest stormwater for non-potable water uses in a building. Two pavement systems were compared through life cycle assessment (LCA). The first system consists of a permeable pavement; in this case, the stormwater filtered by the pavement is used for non-potable water purposes in a building. The second system consists of a flexible pavement (impermeable), with no stormwater harvesting, and with conventional water supply in the building. The method was applied in a case study in a public building in southern Brazil. Water consumption surveys were made and the potential for potable water and electricity savings in the building were estimated. In the inventory, input and output data related to each stage of the life cycle of the systems were gathered and quantified. In the impact assessment, it was found that, for both pavement systems, the most significant damages were related to the implementation and end-of-life stages. The permeable pavement system presented a lower potential for environmental impacts in most midpoint categories evaluated, and also lower overall potential impact in the endpoint approach. The results also showed that the categories with the greatest environmental impact for both systems were fine particulate matter formation and global warming. The method proposed can be used as a basis for guiding planning and decision-making to improve water infrastructure management through stormwater harvesting in urban centres. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Achieving low operational energy (OE) consumption in high heating and cooling situations typically leads to well-insulated buildings. In those cases, embodied energy (EE) can exceed the operational share. Specific literature refers mostly to heating-dominated residential buildings, with a clear focus on European, Asian, and North American countries. Information on embodied impacts of buildings other regions is virtually inexistent. This paper aims at estimating lifecycle energy and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of selected design versions of a photovoltaic-powered Living Lab in Campinas, Brazil; and at finding the embodied-to-operational impact ratios as well as the main contributors to those overall impacts. Homer Energy software supported sizing of photovoltaic (PV) arrays for ten energy compensation scenarios to, based on simulated OE, determine the feasibility threshold for onsite generation admitted by the building design. We then modelled lifecycle energy and GHG emissions for the net zero (NZE) and threshold energy positive (E +) versions of the case study design. The Cumulative Energy Demand (CED) and the CML 2001 v.2.05 methods supported embodied energy and global warming potential (GWP) calculations in SimaPro 7.3. The E + building compensates its OE plus non-renewable energy embodied in building products. Steel frame and partitions were the largest contributors to EEG in building products, whilst the insulated façade panels and PV array performed key energy performance roles at comparatively lower embodied impacts. Shifting from NZE towards E + status discretely increased the embodied-to-operational energy ratio (EE:OE), at similar embodied-to-operational GHG emissions (EG:OG) ratios. Pre-use share of lifecycle CED was slightly surpassed by the operational one, whilst responding for 60% of lifecycle GWP. Material replacement over the reference service life contributed significantly to operational impacts. EOL treatment had negligible effect on lifecycle impacts. EE more than tripled OE and embodied emissions exceeded OG by a factor of seven. EEG prominence confirms the crucial need for a harmonized calculation approach, as experienced for operational stage accountancy over the recent years. We acknowledge the high uncertainties involved in using simulated over measured OE consumption and in using foreign LCI databases. The former limitation can be solved by monitoring operational performance upon projects completion. This study offers practical and detailed reference for LCA practitioners in all countries facing the latter challenge, which will persist until integrated national LCI databases finally become available. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The evaluated public buildings were pioneers in those systems and up to now, are the only public school buildings constructed certified in the country. Environmental assessment systems are significant tools for improving school environmental quality. This research evaluates the management of post-occupancy in those buildings, highlighting the importance in reducing environmental impacts in this most longstanding period in buildings life cycle.

	abstract = {Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) could be a decisive game-changer for the development of household solid waste management (e.g., reduce waste in landfills). However, in a nascent household waste management (HSWM) system, which is characterized by divergent interest groups ranging from the national government, municipalities, waste pickers and householders as providers of waste, implementing MBTs could create positive but also adverse impacts, in particular on waste pickers (WPs). Formal WPs are in cities, like Belo Horizonte (Brazil), a constituent part of the HSWM. This study builds strategies as a form of normative scenarios to assist decision-making processes to deal with WPs and implement MBTs systems. The present study includes material and energy flows, life cycle environmental impacts and social indicators characterized by the number of active WPs and capacity building. The results show that an integrated commitment of the local society can reduce landfilling by 70% and global warming emissions to a quarter. An emphasis on greenhouse gas emissions, like Belo Horizonte's promise for long-term attitude, brings a broad commitment to developing HSWM since a functioning system based on focused strategies will consequently reflect a positive action on climate. Waste pickers can fulfill the estimated vacancies at MBT plants and promote their active life or not according to the capacity building. MBT has substantial room to grow. Therefore, this growth will only happen with new thoughts on the adaptability of MBT systems focused on sufficiency to secure fair conditions for local livelihoods and targets with systemic implications. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

During dry periods in Brazil, the level of water reservoirs decreases and there is the necessity of producing electricity from other sources. Sugarcane bioelectricity is a reliable source during dry periods and has several advantages such as low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and low losses during transmission. Another option for dry periods is the activation of thermoelectric plants driven by fossil natural gas. However, such plants have higher emissions of CO2eq per kWh produced compared to sugarcane bioelectricity. Currently, sugarcane sector is producing bioelectricity mostly from bagasse, but straw (sugarcane tops and leaves) presents a huge potential of additional electricity production. This work presents the estimation of the potential electricity production in Brazil considering the recovery of 50% and 70% of straw produced in sugarcane fields, and the potential avoided emissions comparing to other electricity sources. In addition, we performed a Life Cycle Assessment of four sugarcane plants currently recovering straw in Brazil. By recovering 50% of straw, Brazil could supply 48.6% of Brazilian residential consumption of electricity and avoid emission of 31.1 million tonnes of CO2eq to the atmosphere, which represents around 7% of Brazilian energy sector emissions. Even larger mitigation potential can be achieved with higher straw recovery (70%) or if sugarcane mills are optimized for energy generation. Therefore, straw presents huge potential of additional production of bioelectricity in Brazil and, consequently, a huge potential of GHG mitigation. © 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.},

	abstract = {Because the consumption of materials is generally higher than their recovery rate, improving municipal solid waste (MSW) management is fundamental for increasing the efficiency of natural resource use and consumption in urban areas. More broadly, the characteristics of a MSW management system influence the end-of-life (EOL) impacts of goods consumed by households. We aim to indicate the extent to which greenhouse gas emissions from a MSW management system can be reduced by increasing waste paper recycling. We also address the stakeholders’ contribution for driving transition towards an improved scenario. Life cycle assessment (LCA) addresses the EOL impacts of the paper industry, driven by the characteristics of MSW management in Florianópolis, Brazil, by varying the level of stakeholders’ commitment through different recycling scenarios. The results show that 41% of the climate change impacts from waste paper management could be reduced when increasing the waste paper recycling rates and reducing waste paper landfilling. To achieve such emissions reduction, the industry contribution to the MSW management system would have to increase from 17% in the business-as-usual scenario to 74% in the target scenario. We were able to measure the differences in stakeholders’ contribution by modelling the MSW management system processes that are under the industry’s responsibility separately from the processes that are under the government’s responsibility, based on the Brazilian legal framework. The conclusions indicate that LCA can be used to support policy directions on reducing the impacts of MSW management by increasing resource recovery towards a circular economy. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.},

	abstract = {Despite the growing interest towards the Building Information Modelling (BIM), its widespread use in the entire life cycle of construction products is still incipient. In most of the cases, BIM is not properly used, in an integrated manner, with suppliers and manufacturers of custom building components. The BIM-based digital fabrication of custom building components should be one of the main beneficiaries in changing its old processes to embrace BIM. This fact could be related to the lack of solutions that allow the effective reuse of information contained in the BIM model, especially in supply chains arrangement wherein distinct stakeholders provide key information. This is the case of the Brazilian cut & bent reinforcing bar supply chain in which the interface between the rebar fabricator and the engineering firm are carried out by a General Contractor. Although the available standards allow the exchange of reinforcement data from the design to the fabricator's automated CNC-controlled bending machines, it do not support the input of contractor's requirements, such as reinforcement delivery schedule. Focusing on the Brazilian cut & bent rebar supply chain for Cast-in-place concrete, this article explores the use of the IFC to hold the process and control requirements provided by the contractor. The procurement and planning requirements were identified and presented this way. Alongside, a proposition was made to represent in IFC the information required by the rebar fabricator so it could be reused in their industrial environment. Finally, some suggestions are provided to improve the integration among agents that act in this process.},

	abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can provide the environmental impact of buildings from its initial construction until its demolition. Of particular interest are the environmental impacts of public housing as developing economies are facing the growing need for housing. However, the validity of the LCA results is directly related to how representative is the inventory data to regional characteristics. Existing LCA of buildings in Brazil frequently ignores regional data when compiling the LCA and there is a lack of study on this topic. This study performs an LCA that compares two types of public housing in southern Brazil: single-family dwellings (house condominium) and multi-family dwellings (apartment condominium). The unit areas compared are of similar size, and the construction methods and materials used are also similar. The LCA was performed using regionalized and non-regionalized inventory data based on ISO 14040/44 and EN 15804 (modules A to C). Data from the Ecoinvent database v.3.3 was used with adaptations that reflected regional characteristics of Brazilian construction practices. Results show that the use stage (module B) is the most relevant in all environmental impact categories considered, particularly relevant are the electricity consumed (module B6) and replacement of constructions materials (module B4). Despite similar overall impacts, the single-family dwelling exhibited higher impact numbers compared to the multi-family dwelling, largely due to design and construction characteristics (module A). Regionalized data strongly influenced the results when compared to non-regionalized background data; therefore, the results obtained using non-regionalized data may lead to inconsistent decision-making. This study is one of the first LCA of buildings in Brazil using inventory data regionalized to local conditions and demonstrates the importance of regionalization since environmental impacts can vary significantly. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This paper presents the first inventory and environmental impact study of the life cycle of coal obtained from a surface mine in Brazil. Significant reserves of coal in Brazil have attracted the attention of investors interested in building chemical and power generation plants. This inventory was developed to serve as a database for Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies, considering especially the impact of greenhouse gases, since there is no such information in the literature. The inventory collected data in situ, regarding the main pieces of equipment, inputs to the plant, and the direct emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), covering different stages of the coal mining and processing, as well as the indirect emissions of GHG from the production and transportation of inputs. The coal life cycle emissions were equal to 3.29 × 10−2 kg CO2eq per kg of coal, of which direct emissions accounted for 98.3% of GHG, in which the major part was due to fugitive methane emissions from surface mining and post-mining coal crushing and handling operations. Additionally, the results of a sensitivity analysis showed that the diesel oil consumption was the most influential parameter of life cycle emission in terms of the inputs regarded. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

Given the historical background of continued environmental degradation caused by human needs, which resulted in serious risks to society, and knowing that more than 60% of solid wastes generated in urban centers are from the construction site, the need arises to develop techniques and solutions to mitigate these impacts. Structure of the research/approaches: The paper is structured in four parts: description of an evolutionary history regarding environmental concern, a sustainable construction issue approach, surveying interference at the stage of site construction, and a case study focusing on environmental sustainability during the site construction phase of an enterprise. Contributions: The characteristics of a sustainable building interfere directly in the relation between man/environment with issues that can be minimized when designing a project, which should be applied from the construction of a building to the end of its life cycle.

Associations between HFI (measured with the Brazilian Food Insecurity Scale) and excess weight/obesity were investigated through Poisson regression models. While severe HFI was associated with obesity risk among adult women (PR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.17-1.90), moderate HFI was associated with excess weight among female adolescents (PR: 1.96; 95%CI: 1.18-3.27). There was no association between HFI and obesity among children (either boys or girls). The nutrition transition in Brazil may be shaping the differential deleterious effect of HFI on body fat accumulation across the life course; the association is already evident among female adolescents and adult women but still not among children.},

Methods: Te 9 areas were grouped into 4 strata according to soil use and occupation. Larvae and pupas were collected in a sample of approximately 500 buildings in each area. Results: Although tires and canvas presented the highest positive rates for Aedes aegypti, drains and other containers fxed to the buildings were highly predominant among positive containers; 32 to 76% of the positive containers in the 4 study strata. Public areas of apartment buildings and large non-residential premises presented the highest positive rates for Aedes Aegypti, while apartments presented the lowest. Infestation levels were greater in residential areas with predominance of apartment buildings, where 76% of the breeding sites detected were containers fixed to the buildings. Conclusions: This knowledge is an important tool in the control strategy, since it reinforces the need for special atention regarding certain types of buildings and the adjustment of technical norms for pluvial water drains and improvement of building maintenance. Moreover, systematic observations are required to follow-up the occupancy dynamic of different buildings and containers by Aedes aegypti and the incorporation of this knowledge in the control of vectors in the region.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that uses the Monte Carlo Method (MCM) to estimate the behavior of economic parameters which may help decision, considering the risk in project sustainability. In order to show how this methodology can be used, a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System (GCPVS) of 1.575kWp, located on the roof top of the laboratory building of the Grupo de Estudos e Desenvolvimento de Alternativas Energéticas - GEDAE, at the Universidade Federal do Pará - UFPA, Belém - Pará - Brazil, and operating since December 2007, is analyzed. This system was chosen because it was the first GCPVS installed in the Brazilian Amazon Region, being the first risk evaluation on using a renewable energy source connected to the grid in the Region. This work also presents a similar treatment for the case of a stand-alone photovoltaic system (SAPVS) installed in the remote Santo AntÔnio Village, municipality of Breves, Pará, Brazil, considering the risk of investment assumed by an investor in power generation projects with similar characteristics or using other renewable energy sources. The last case allows a better assessment for other important applications of renewable energy in the Amazon Region, where the demand for energy is growing, but is still costly and often not a priority in government actions. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The CHESF - Companhia Hidro Elétrica do São Francisco - is a federal controlled company, the bigger electric enterprise in Brazil. Currently, it is composed of 14 hydroelectric generation plants and one thermoelectric, in a total of 10, 618.32MW. Its transmission system has 94 substations and more than 18, 00km of power lines, amongst 69, 138, 230 and 500kV. In order to unify and standardize the operation and maintenance management of all its assets, including telecommunication, computers, generators, power transformers, etc., CHESF has formulated the SIGA (Sistema Integrado de Gestão de Ativos - Asset Management Integrated System) - An Information System specifically designed to support its asset management and operation, as a whole. Being a public company and in accordance with the Brazilian law, the acquisition of the software was bided at an auction, which leaded to the cheapest IT solution considering all the specifications. In Forma Software (a local software house), based on Equipmaint", has supplied all the CHESF requirements for the SIGA project, and developed such a complex solution in two years, since the contract signature till the full acceptance into the electric system operation. Besides the large dimensions of CHESF, which covers a huge territorial area (above 1 million squared kilometers) and imposes a rational use of telecommunication networks (TCP/IP Wide Area Network), SIGA has many new customized features that easy strategic asset management in a complex matrix organization environment. It has been developed to allow and encourage the use of RCM (Reliability Centered Maintenance) and LCC (Life Cycle Cost), and supports SLA (Service Level Agreement) management and BI (Business Intelligence) tools. SIGA deploys an integrated database with all the equipment records, operation occurrences and the maintenance work orders. It also allows distinct hierarchies for the programmed maintenances, medium and long-term activities planning, performance and reliability indicators and hazards precautions. Particular user-assembled routines allow automatic work orders generation that takes into account the age, usage, particular characteristics of the equipments and even predictive diagnosis, such as thermo vision, vibration and chemical analysis. SIGA was designed to interface distinct teams, e.g. operation, predictive and corrective maintenance. That prevents waste of time, human errors, misunderstandings and administrative overturns. It is a pretty novelty in the power sector. Furthermore, it was designed in compliance with the regulatory agencies. SIGA also optimizes large stops in critical systems, such as generation machines and power lines, making possible to wisely schedule simultaneous work orders for several maintenance teams, one for each subsystem. This feature reduces costs related to unavailability into large power systems, such as generation plants, substations or transmission power lines. It is an interesting feature for industries which needs equipment replacement or refurbishment, above all, considering regulatory restructuring. An intensive work has been applied to make available its many useful innovative features at high customization level and low costs. It was, and still is, a great challenge for CHESF. This paper is intended to share the main experiences taken from the SIGA project.},

The assessments carried out take into consideration the construction, maintenance and end of life of the walls, for a specific tropical climate site. The energy spent for heating and cooling during the utilization phase of the building was made equivalent for all calculations, in order to isolate the study on the evaluation of the performance of each technical solution. Initially, the methodology is described by choosing technical solutions to the building envelope, determining the corresponding service life for each solution and finding the corresponding GHG index from an appropriate database. Then, the evolution of this indicator is calculated within a given time for the four different technical solutions: Concrete Block; Solid Clay Brick; Cellular Concrete Block; Multicell Clay Brick. Brazilian national standard materials lifespans were adopted. A building lifespan of 150 years was considered. The results of this analysis suggest and quantify the important impact of the lifespans of both the materials and the building itself on greenhouse gas emission indicators. The numerical results presented point out the need to revisit the current life cycle analysis practices. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The construction sector plays an important role in most economies; therefore, any waste reduction in a building's life cycle will result in a significant benefit to the economy. It is at the building design phase that most costs and wastes are defined for the entire building life cycle. Moreover, many forms of waste are also accumulated during the design phase itself. This article presents a new approach for organizing and managing the building design phase in a more effective and efficient way. This approach, called project cell, promotes concurrent engineering and lean management principles to achieve better performance during the design of a building. The project cell approach was implemented in the design process of a generic kindergarten project for the Brazilian Ministry of Education. In this case study, the implementation of project cell resulted in better productivity in the building design process as well as more effective building designs when compared with the traditional departmentalized approaches. The authors believe that introducing project cell may be valuable contribution to the Construction Engineering Management (CEM) body of knowledge. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Fixed effects regression models of used area and forested area show few consistent effects of changes in household demography on land use and land cover change. Effects are inconsistent with the household life cycle model that currently dominates the literature on household demographic effects in frontiers. Changes in the number of children and women, particularly young women, have the most significant effects on land use and land cover change.

The people structure is based on process safety local focal points, called LAGRI's (leaders of management and analysis of risks and impacts), accountable for every specific industrial area as follows: production, process, maintenance and HSE (health, safety and environmental).One important LAGRIs role is to guarantee that risk management is understood and it is spreading out through all its company chain. This structure is distributed within process engineering, production and industrial maintenance departments thru senior members, that besides their regular duties, have to: coordinating the activities related to impact and hazards analysis in the Production Unit/Plant, disseminating and equalizing the knowledge related to impact and hazards analysis among production unit teams, coordinating the running of periodic risk scenario studies of impact and hazards every five years, coordinating the implementation of suggestions/recommendations from those analysis, including complementary studies (quantitative analysis) and establishing monitor performance indicators for management of impacts and risks.

A construction project well adjusted to the user requirements increase value and causes minors changes during its life cycle. As a consequence, renewal, refurbishments, and demolition are less present, reducing waste generation, reworking and material consumption. It is especially important in housing customization markets. However, one of the challenges faced by designers is frequently concerned about how properly to identify user requirements, wishes and needs, which are on the essence of the briefing phase. In this context, real estate data can be useful to designers, since it reflects the users' evaluation of the building attributes. The research strategy uses a knowledge discovery mechanism, composed by five steps: (1) formulation of a general database; (2) specific data selection using Case-Based Reasoning; (3) enrichment of data-sample; (4) development of hedonic price models using regression analysis; and (5) simulation of the value of design alternatives. Based on an application of an hedonic price model, using data from the medium-class housing market of Porto Alegre, Brazil, the main results indicate that adjusted price models have sufficient detailing and statistical precision to support decisions in the initial stage of design.},

To achieve this, architects and engineers need reliable data on the environmental impacts of various building materials, including ceramic bricks. In this paper a comparative Life Cycle Assessment between two ceramic brick production units in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, has been carried in a comparative approach. Key impact categories, including fossil fuel use, global warming, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity were assessed. The analysis has shown a particular relevance of the respiratory effects in both systems and the critical point has been found in the fuel used in the furnace for firing the bricks which are responsible, during the firing process, for the relevant CO2 emissions. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis is an important metazoonosis caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania and has a heteroxenic life cycle involving invertebrate and vertebrate hosts. Transmission occurs during the blood meal of infected phlebotomine sand flies in wild species, domestic animals, and humans. The dog is a reservoir for the parasite causing visceral leishmaniasis (VL), whereas in American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL), dogs are erratic hosts that are accidentally infected, as in humans. Dogs are considered an important indicator of the parasite and its vectors in the environment, thus highlighting the importance of diagnosis in these animals. This study aimed to assess the seroepidemiology of Leishmania spp. in dogs in the municipality of Telêmaco Borba that were part of a castration campaign. Blood samples from 191 dogs were collected, and their owners were surveyed on various epidemiological variables. Serological analysis was performed using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and rapid immunochromatography (DPP®). Screening by IIF identified 13 (6.81%) positive animals, none of which were positive for the DPP® test, which is specific for VL. Statistical analysis of the questionnaire responses indicated a significant association between seropositivity and the presence of stacked or composting leaves in the backyard (p = 0.0498), forest areas (squares, woods, parks) near the residence (p = 0.0015), and poorly healing ulcerated or nodular epidermal lesions in the dog (p = 0.0138). This study revealed the presence of anti-Leishmania spp. IgG antibodies in dogs residing in Telêmaco Borba, suggesting the presence of the parasite and vector in the environment. In addition, the existence of stacked or composting leaves in the backyard, forest areas near the residence, and epidermal lesions in dogs are factors associated with Leishmania spp. infection in pet dogs.},

	abstract = {Introduction: We noticed an emphasis on mortality from external causes, especially homicides that occur among the male youth population, characterized as aggressor and victim, currently representing one of the major problems for public health. Brazil has, then, been concerned with interventions aimed at decreasing youth victims of violence and the promotion of a culture of peace. For this purpose, we consider essential to understand the psychosocial risks that may be present in the developmental trajectory of this population. This is the major purpose of this study. Methods: To understand violence in the contemporary Brazilian scenario, we present some results obtained through a literature review. Results: Thus, recent studies show that the risk factors that may affect young people throughout their life cycle are of various levels: physical, psychological, economic, sociocultural etc. Moreover, the protective factors that young people acquire in adverse contexts will also have to be addressed for a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Thus, we find as relevant risk factors: low socioeconomic status and perceived impossibility of consumption of material goods; poor housing conditions; experience and exposure to intrafamily and community violence including police violence; exposure and contact with drugs; history of physical and psychological abuse; low education; existence of family members with low education, unqualified to work and involved in crime; access to weapons; belonging to gangs; experience of long periods of social exclusion and poverty; feeling threatened by violence and powerlessness in the face of it; and belief that violence is a legitimate solution to social conflicts. Regarding protective factors, studies have highlighted social support networks (school, work, friends, and institutions), skills to protect and negotiate rights and interests, positive images of others, the expectation of help from neighbors and the community in general, high self-esteem and family supervision. Personal factors that contribute in this direction, such as self-esteem and spirituality were also highlighted. Conclusion: However, the interpretation given by the subject suffering a certain stress will determine the degree of impairment in their development. This is one of the reasons why the risk factors must be associated with the protective factors, because not all subjects who undergo the same psychological and social stressors will become vulnerable to other harmful aspects to their development such as involvement in crime by instance. For this reason, describing groups and risk factors becomes essential to seek specific interventions, for gender, age, color, geographical space and social and economic conditions are important variables to specify forms of incidence and prevalence of violence. However, it will be on the individual considered as a whole (physical and psychological), that violence will ensue, either as victim or as perpetrator.},

Sampling was conducted at three stations in the lower estuary channel, between 2002 and 2010, in relation to season, day and night and tidal variations. A total of 5802 Gobiidae larvae, representing 15 taxa (12 species and three morphotypes), were collected in the Mucuri Estuary during this time. The highest mean±s.d. density of fish larvae, 54·7±79·8 larvae 100m-3, was recorded during the flood tide and night sampling. Ctenogobius boleosoma was the most abundant species (68%), being dominant in the rainy and dry seasons and had a long reproductive period. This species was classed as a marine estuarine-opportunist because it was observed at high frequencies and active larvae entering the estuary between 6·1 and 12·0mm standard length (LS). Gobionellus oceanicus, second in abundance (12%), occurred only in later larval stages but did not use the estuary as a preferred location for spawning, being classed a marine estuarine dependent. Microgobius carri (11%) was represented in all LS classes and was resident in the estuary for spawning, remaining there throughout their life cycle. The other species were considered rare due to their low densities and could not be classified in any guild. © 2014 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

	abstract = {During a pipeline life cycle, some significant changes in the population may happen along its route. Such changes are indirectly evaluated by the increase in the amount of buildings constructed along the route, which determines the so called Location Class. Such changes, after licensing, provoke differences between what is required by the standards and what is actually done. This work has two goals. One is to study the requirements of international standards and legislations as well as some solutions used in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Netherlands. This goal intends to provide some technical bases for a comparative analysis on how the location class changes, during the life cycle of a pipeline, are treated in each country. Another goal is to present a risk-based methodology for the guideline development which can be used in decision-making concerning what to do in case of any location class change. Particularly, it has given special attention to the requirements which are imposed for the pipeline operational license continuation. This work is of supreme importance for the Brazilian pipeline segment, since the existing Brazilian design standard, ABNT NBR12712 for transmission and distribution pipeline design, does not deal with that issue. Moreover, a summary of the main solutions found in those countries together with a guideline, customized for the Brazilian reality, is presented.

As only the building operation is considered, the energy input to deliver the building and its components or involved in any other building lifecycle stage is not accounted for. This paper has TEA Annex57 as backdrop and applies a meaningful lifecycle perspective based on the cumulative energy demand (CED) approach to a demo building in Brazil. Ten energy balance scenarios were simulated, ranging from net zero to complete building life cycLe, to determine the feasibility threshold for CED neutralization onsite. Modelling used secondary data collected from literature or adapted from SimaPro 7.3 built-in Ecoinvent v 2.2, ELCD v 2.0, US LCI v.1.6 and Industry Data v.2.0 datasets. Energy Plus e Homer Energy supported estimation of operational energy and PV array sizing. Raw material supply and product manufacturing within the Product stage (43%) proved to he as relevant as the use stage (52%) CED. Neutralization of the total operational electricity plus the non-renewable CED embodied in building products was the highest achievable goal for the case studied. The corresponding PV array is ablc to produce 3,7 times the necessary operational electricity. Beyond such threshold, extra land would be needed for PV installation. Though the CED approach results in substantial PV area demands, by expressing the whole energy involved in delivering, using and dismantling buildings, it provides a more appropriate description of reality and better informs decision-making by building professionals, construction and transportation/I ogistic services and policy makers.},

	abstract = {The replacement of plumbing fixtures is a regular practice in the implementation of water conservation programmes in existing buildings. However, even though such programmes aim at reducing water consumption, it is necessary to understand the environmental implications of the replacement of ordinary plumbing fixtures with water-saving versions. The feasibility of such a practice, in terms of environmental aspects, should be evaluated in order to verify its effectiveness. This paper describes the application of a methodology to evaluate the environmental impacts involved in the replacement of ordinary taps with water-saving ones based on life-cycle assessment. The method quantifies inputs and outputs in the production, use, and disposal phases of the plumbing fixtures under analysis. The impact categories considered are global warming potential, depletion of the ozone layer, human toxicity, acidification, water consumption, and energy consumption. In order to assess the economic impacts, Life Cycle Cost methodology was applied. The method was applied in a water conservation programme of a university campus in Southern Brazil. The results indicate that the use phase of both ordinary and water-saving taps present strong influence in four impact categories (global warming potential, depletion of the ozone layer, water consumption, and energy consumption). Life Cycle Cost was estimated as R$245.99 and R$316.20 for the ordinary and water-saving taps, respectively. Such results show that the adoption of water-saving taps is not economically feasible without incentives from the public sector. On the other hand, the environmental performance of the water-saving tap was superior for all environmental impact categories analysed herein. The results indicate that the replacement of ordinary taps with water-saving taps would reduce water consumption by 26.2%, energy consumption by 13.6%, human toxicity by 4.6%, acidification by 0.2%, global warming potential by 14.8% and depletion of the ozone layer by 15.8%. Although the replacement of ordinary taps is not economically feasible, the use of water-saving taps is recommended on the campus where the study was conducted based on the environmental impacts in the life cycle. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Accurate determination of infection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) has been hindered by the lack of a "gold standard" for comparison of serological assays used to estimate KSHV prevalence in serosurveys conducted in different settings. We have evaluated the performance of five in-house (developed at University College London [UCL], United Kingdom, and at the virology laboratory of the Instituto de Medicine Tropical [IMT] in Sao Paulo, Brazil) and two commercial (ABI and DIAVIR) serological assays to detect antibodies to latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and to lytic KSHV antigens. We used a variety of serum samples assembled to represent populations likely to be at high, intermediate, and low risk of KSHV infection in Brazil. Composite reference standard panels were prepared based on clinical and serological parameters, against which assay performances were assessed using conventional Bayesian statistics and latent class analysis (LCA). Against the clinical reference standard, in-house immunofluorescence assays to detect anti-LANA antibodies (IFA-LANA) produced at UCL and IMT had similar performances, with sensitivities of 61% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48% to 74%) and 72% (95% CI, 58% to 83%) and specificities of 99% (95% CI, 94% to 100%) and 100% (95% CI, 96% to 100%), respectively, and only the IMT IFA-LANA was included in LCA, together with the IMT IFA-lytic and four enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The LCA indicated that the IMT whole-virus ELISA performed best (sensitivity, 87% [95% CI, 81% to 91%]; and specificity, 100% [95% CI, 98% to 100%]), confirming the results obtained with the conventional statistical approach. Commercially available ELISA-based tests yielded the lowest specificities using a spectrum of serum samples. The evaluation of KSHV serological assays is warranted before planning serosurveys in various settings. Copyright © 2007, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian "National Electricity Conservation Program" - PROCEL - runs regular surveys in the electric-energy-consumption market. These studies are used as valuable data to better plan the actions of this program. These data also evaluate the program's performance by identifying the level of penetration of the most efficient electric equipment within the residential sector. PROCEL's main lines of action is to promote and make available the most efficient technologies. Based on the results from the latest survey, it is estimated that 24% of the electric-energy consumption of the residential sector is used by electric shower devices, which instantaneously heat the water that flows through them, normally using an electric resistance of 5 kW. These are an important factor in a country where electric-heating devices are present in about 73% of Brazilian households. Keeping that in mind, the purpose of this work is to present the main results of the Brazilian Solar-Water-Heating-Systems Evaluation, finished in 2010, where 535 installations were visited and more than 50 researchers from different universities participated in the project. Moreover, seven Brazilian cities were selected to be studied. The information was collected from field research and statistically treated. The collected information focused on the adequacy of the project to the household, installation, operation and life cycle of the systems, as well as the users' satisfaction level. Technical questionnaires were developed to summarize all the required information, such as a Web site designed to organize and manage the data collected and a Matlab application that performed the dimensioning and F-chart systems evaluation. Quality indicators were created through a full system monitoring, with thermographic analysis and evaluation of shading influence at the system's efficiency, using the Ecotect software.},

	abstract = {The traditional paradigm of civil construction design process has been characterised predominantly by linear logic with the absence of any integration among the different parts that constitute the life cycle of an enterprise. This scenerio begins at the design stage, resulting from the neglect of its management, in such a way that planning and controlling are replaced by chaos and improvisation. Many design-related deficiencies are due to the lack of communication among designers and little collaboration from the involved agents. As a response for this situation, the principles of Concurrent Engineering and of Design for Excellence (DFE) methods should be taken into consideration. DFE includes Design for Maintenance (DFM) practices, which are currently a relevant subject for the building sector, as buildings are expected to last for decades and the necessity of adaptation throughout their operational lives (including the reduction of energy consumption and bioclimatic demands) is very clear. Considering that maintenance includes several different factors and agents, this research aims to provide guidelines for occupational safety at heights during the maintenance stage of an enterprise, hoping to avoid accidents at the workplace-which is an important matter in the contemporary Brazilian context. For this purpose, a bibliographical revision was made from both national and international sources. As a result, we hope to contribute for the design process in the civil construction field. The diffusion of this subject’s importance among the professionals in this field was perceived as necessary for an effective contribution to design practices, since these guidelines are not mandatory in the current legislation, although they would be a differential for the design process and the enterprise as a whole. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

	abstract = {The foraging activity of Geotrigona mombuca Smith, 1863 was studied under natural conditions aiming to verify the influence of seasonal changes on daily flight activity and annual cycle of the colony. Daily flight activity was monitored for a year based on the observation and counting of foragers leaving and entering the hive, as well as the kind of material transported and meteorological factors such as day time, temperature and relative humidity. The influence of seasonal changes was evidenced by alterations on daily rhythm of flight activity and by differences on transportation of food resources, building material and garbage. These data indicate that forager behavior is related to daily microclimate conditions and it is synchronized with the requirements of colony annual cycle, which determines an intense pollen collection in the summer. Thus, the recomposition of the intranidal population in spring and summer can be ensured, which is characterized both for a higher intensity of flight activity and increase in garbage and resin transport, as well as the swarming process in the spring. In this way, an action targeting the preservation or management of the species in a natural environment should consider that survival and reproduction of the colony depends greatly on the amount of available pollen in late winter.},

	abstract = {The caridean freshwater shrimp Atya scabra is a common resident of stream systems of tropical rainforests in America, including Brazilian drainages. This shrimp has an amphidromous life cycle, which increases its vulnerability when facing habitat fragmentation. Since information on the reproduction of this species is still limited, we present here data on egg production, egg loss, and energy investment, to achieve a better understanding of reproductive features of A. scabra. Specimens were collected between 2006 and 2007 in São Sebastião Island, southeastern Brazil, in 13 locations. The fecundity of 21 ovigerous females analyzed ranged between 414 and 19,250 eggs, which were higher than previously reported. However, the larger size of females analyzed may explain the observed intraspecific difference in egg production. During embryogenesis, egg volume and water content increased by 103 and 22.6%, respectively. The initial egg volume of A. scabra in the present study (0.027 mm3) was slightly lower, but comparable to the values reported previously from the same study area. During incubation, females of A. scabra lost 15% of their initially produced eggs. The reproductive output (average RO of 3.6%) is the first report for any atyid species. Its value is fairly low compared to other freshwater shrimps, and it is hypothesized that this might be related to a high energy investment in morphological adaptations, which allows the shrimp to cling on to the substrate in the fast flowing environment they inhabit. Additionally, the long life span, a well-known phenomenon in atyid shrimp, may allow the species to invest a relatively low amount of energy per brood in egg production, but over a longer time span.},

For each case study it has been made an inventory, identifying as a main handicap, the lack of inventory data in commercial databases adapted to different countries, different factions and different treatments of waste management. To solve this problem, inventory modeling has been performed as a combination of primary and secondary data. Finally, the contribution to different impact categories of stage of each life cycle waste management system has been obtained.

However, much of our knowledge of such processes is derived from studies of bird of temperate regions, with few studies on subtropical or tropical birds. We studied the annual patterns of moult, development of brood patches and fat deposition in a subtropical lowland bird community in southern Brazil and examined the relationship between these patterns and temperature, precipitation and day length. We made 1702 captures of 97 species of birds. Moult and breeding overlap partially in the overall community. Moult of contour feathers occurred year-round, whereas moult of flight feathers occurred from the end of October to the end of May. Migratory species had a shorter moult period than resident species. Breeding peaked in spring (SeptemberDecember). Fat was deposited seasonally, and the fattest individuals were observed between the end of the moult period and the beginning of breeding. Our data showed that ultimate factors (photoperiod and temperature) influenced vital processes of the life cycles of birds studied. The patterns detected in the seasonality and duration of breeding, moult and fat deposition in this community are generally similar to those of birds in temperate zones. © 2011 Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union.},

More than ever, the growing demand for construction materials reflects increased consumption of raw materials and energy, particularly during the phases of extraction, processing, and transportation of materials. This work aims to help decision-makers and to promote life cycle thinking in the construction industry. For this purpose, the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was chosen to analyze the environmental impacts of building materials used in the construction of a residence project in São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The LCA methodology, based on ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 guidelines, is applied with available databases and the SimaPro program. As a result, this work shows that there is a substantial waste of nonrenewable energy, increasing global warming and harm to human health in this type of construction.

The aim of the present study was to optimize the monetary and environmental costs associated with pieces of rectangular reinforced concrete columns submitted to uniaxial bending and compression loads, using the harmony search algorithm, which consists of a meta-heuristic approach analogous to the process of attaining the best musical harmony. Therefore, in addition to taking into account the purchasing costs of materials in the structural optimization process, analyses were conducted to determine the environmental costs of each input, estimated from the life-cycle analysis. The sizes of concrete section and the amount and gauges of the structures, as well as concrete strength, were used as variables. The columns were checked as to ultimate and serviceability limit states following the ABNT NBR 6118/07 Brazilian standard. Several indicators were used for environmental cost minimization, and the results were compared to those obtained from conventional sizing processes as well as from other optimization methods. In general, even with structure optimization to minimize monetary costs, important reductions in environmental costs are obtained, regardless of the indicator used for impact analysis, thus yielding cross-sections with different features. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The objective of this research was to determine the temperature comfort, evaluated in terms of temperature and indices Black Globe Temperature and Humidity (BGTH), appropriate to the creation of quails in the final phase. Were housed 300 quails in different thermal environments. Each group of 60 birds were distributed randomly into 03 chambers, with 10 birds per pen (cage), totaling 15 treatments. The treatments were: CP - Comfort Pressed (temperatures of 26 and 25 °C, respectively, for fourth and fifth week of creation); MH - Moderate heat (30 °C for the fourth and fifth week of creation) and HS - Heat Severus (33 °C for the fourth and fifth week of creation). During the fourth week of creation quail (22-28 days), the best value of BGTH was 75.8 ± 0.9 and for the fifth week of creation (29-35 days) BGTH 75.3 ± 0, 7 (indicative of thermal comfort for this age). It was found that: quail maintained in thermal stress (either hot or cold) during the initial phase can not recover the end of the life cycle, even when reared under conditions of thermal comfort in the initial stage after this period, while kept at temperatures of heat stress is moderate or severe chronic, can not keep up with the normal performance, demonstrating the need to ensure that the thermal environment of poultry is kept in accordance with the appropriate requirements for each age of the quail.},

We build on his holistic approach to mobility and examine dynamic changes in land use and migration among small farm families in Altamira, Pará, Brazil. We find that prior area in either pasture or perennials promotes out-migration of adult children, but that out-migration is not directly associated with land-use change. In contrast to early formulations of household life cycle models that argued that aging parents would decrease productive land use as children left the farm, we find no effect of out-migration of adult children on land-use change. Instead, remittances facilitate increases in area in perennials, a slower to pay off investment that requires scarce capital, but in pasture. While remittances are rare, they appear to permit sound investments in the rural milieu and thus to slow rural exodus and the potential consolidation of land into large holdings. We would do well to promote the conditions that allow them to be sent and to be used productively to keep families on the land to avoid the specter of extensive deforestation for pasture followed by land consolidation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

	abstract = {Rebar corrosion is one of the most important and widespread pathological manifestation in reinforced concrete structures. According to the prevailing bilinear deterioration model, the corrosion process is divided in two phases, initiation and propagation. Most studies in the area have been focused on the modeling of the initiation phase, because it defines the design service life. The propagation period, however, which starts after the depassivation of the rebar, is structurally more relevant, because the level of damage and the risk increase rapidly. Given the fact that the corrosion process in many structures has already entered the propagation phase, it is vital to increase the knowledge about how the propagation phase evolves. To ascertain the resistance or susceptibility to corrosion of different concrete mixes and protection measures, it is necessary to have adequate test procedures. There is a lack of standardization in this area, especially in Brazil, which leads to the use of several accelerated tests. The present work is focused on the study of a test procedure named CAIM (Accelerated Test by modified immersion), which evolved over the last 20 years in the Structural Test and Modeling Laboratory (LEME) of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The work compares data obtained using two different strategies for corrosion acceleration, based on the imposition of voltage or current differences. Results were succesfully modelled using a Monte Carlo simulation. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

Knowing that the measures chosen to achieve the credits may differ from country to country, the present study aimed to identify and evaluate the construction practices implemented to achieve sustainability certification for two Brazilian buildings and analyze their possible Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) risk impacts. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire and personal interviews with stakeholders involved in the certification process, using specially designed tools for this purpose and companies documents analysis. It was observed that some measures adopted in the construction process contributed positively both to environmental and to OSH improvement. However, some of the measures chosen increased the accidents risk at construction sites, such as photovoltaic panels and large glass panels on the building facade installation. It is expected that this study results may help certification agencies to consider explicitly the OSH aspects when granting sustainability credits, ensuring that sustainable buildings are above all safe for all types of users including the workers that are involved during the entire buildings life cycle.},

	abstract = {The population structure, growth and production of the trigonal clam Tivela mactroides were investigated by monthly sampling between January 2003 and October 2004 in two areas (southern and northern) of the intertidal and subtidal zones of Caraguatatuba Bay, Southeastern Brazil. Intertidal sampling was carried out in each area along eight transects perpendicular to the shoreline. In the subtidal zone of both areas, one 50-m dredging was performed along five sampling stations arranged on three transects perpendicular to the coast. The intertidal abundance of T. mactroides was higher in the southern (more dissipative conditions) than in the northern area. High abundances occurred in February-March 2004 in the south and in September 2004 in the north. The size structure showed that younger individuals dominated in the sublittoral, indicating that recruitment occurs in this zone, followed by the migration of these individuals to the intertidal, where they complete their life cycle. Tivela mactroides showed continuous reproduction, with 26 cohorts detected in the study period. The lower estimates for the growth index (ϕ{symbol}′ = 3.22), mortality rate (Z = 2.10 year-1) and turnover rate (P/B = 1.21 year-1), and conversely the longer life span (2.5 years) of T. mactroides in Caraguatatuba Bay (24°S) compared with Venezuelan populations (10°N) suggests a latitudinal pattern of these life-history traits. The high production of T. mactroides in Caraguatatuba Bay was due to continuous recruitment and rapid and continuous growth, and demonstrates the importance of T. mactroides as a biological resource for many marine species and for the local residents. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.},

The procedures of Process Risk Management were based on international standards like CCPS, API, NFPA, ISA, OSHA and etc, as well as Brazilian regulation. This work aims to present Braskem's experience for managing process safety using its decentralized structure based on specific process safety local focal points.},

	abstract = {Background: Neighborhood environment studies of physical activity (PA) have been mainly single-country focused. The International Prevalence Study (IPS) presented a rare opportunity to examine neighborhood features across countries. The purpose of this analysis was to: 1) detect international neighborhood typologies based on participants' response patterns to an environment survey and 2) to estimate associations between neighborhood environment patterns and PA.Methods: A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted on pooled IPS adults (N=11,541) aged 18 to 64 years old (mean=37.5 ±12.8 yrs; 55.6% women) from 11 countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the U.S. This subset used the Physical Activity Neighborhood Environment Survey (PANES) that briefly assessed 7 attributes within 10-15 minutes walk of participants' residences, including residential density, access to shops/services, recreational facilities, public transit facilities, presence of sidewalks and bike paths, and personal safety. LCA derived meaningful subgroups from participants' response patterns to PANES items, and participants were assigned to neighborhood types. The validated short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) measured likelihood of meeting the 150 minutes/week PA guideline. To validate derived classes, meeting the guideline either by walking or total PA was regressed on neighborhood types using a weighted generalized linear regression model, adjusting for gender, age and country.Results: A 5-subgroup solution fitted the dataset and was interpretable. Neighborhood types were labeled, " Overall Activity Supportive (52% of sample)" , " High Walkable and Unsafe with Few Recreation Facilities (16%)" , " Safe with Active Transport Facilities (12%)" , " Transit and Shops Dense with Few Amenities (15%)" , and " Safe but Activity Unsupportive (5%)" . Country representation differed by type (e.g., U.S. disproportionally represented " Safe but Activity Unsupportive" ). Compared to the Safe but Activity Unsupportive, two types showed greater odds of meeting PA guideline for walking outcome (High Walkable and Unsafe with Few Recreation Facilities, OR= 2.26 (95% CI 1.18-4.31); Overall Activity Supportive, OR= 1.90 (95% CI 1.13-3.21). Significant but smaller odds ratios were also found for total PA.Conclusions: Meaningful neighborhood patterns generalized across countries and explained practical differences in PA. These observational results support WHO/UN recommendations for programs and policies targeted to improve features of the neighborhood environment for PA. © 2013 Adams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

	abstract = {In tropical forests, the leaf-litter stratum exhibits one of the greatest abundances of ant species. This diversity is associated with the variety of available locations for nest building. Ant nests can be found in various microhabitats, including tree trunks and fallen twigs in different stages of decomposition. In this study, we aimed to investigate undecomposed twigs as nest-building resources in the leaf litter of dense ombrophilous forest areas in the southeastern region of Brazil. Demographic data concerning the ant colonies, the physical characteristics of the nests, and the population and structural of the forest were observed. Collections were performed manually over four months in closed canopy locations that did not have trails or flooded areas. A total of 294 nests were collected, and 34 ant species were recorded. Pheidole, Camponotus, and Hypoponera were the richest genera observed; these genera were also among the most populous and exhibited the greatest abundance of nests. We found no association between population size and nest diameter. Only tree cover influenced the nest abundance and species richness. Our data indicate that undecomposed twigs may be part of the life cycle of many species and are important for maintaining ant diversity in the leaf litter. © 2012 Tae Tanaami Fernandes et al.},

Therefore, 7 Brazilian cities were selected to be studied, then information will be collected and statistically treated leading to later field research. At that stage, the collected information are the real design conditions, installation, operation and life cycle of the systems and users satisfaction level. In order to obtain and treat the information properly some products were developed such as: technical questionnaires to summarize all the required information; a website designed to organize and manage the collected data; and a Matlab application that perform the dimensioning based on the F-Chart system. Quality indicators are being created through a full system monitoring, with the use of thermographic analysis and evaluation of shading influence at the system's efficiency, using the Ecotect software. Until now, more than 340 installations were visited of 800 intended to be studied. This article presents some results of the residential sector, observed at 3 cities: Belo Horizonte, Campinas and Rio de Janeiro. This project, nationwide, is unprecedented and will get a list of recommendations geared to formulate an initial plan for the development of the sector, which could be used as a basis and guideline for government policies.

The aim of this study is to analyze the morphological and anatomical aspects of the structure of Rollinia sylvatica (A. St.-Hil.) Mart seedlings, which is a native species from South of Brazil. The seedlings were obtained from seeds collected in Antonina, state of Paraná. The germination was carried out in a green house condition. Seedlings and tirodendros were collected 2, 4, 8, 18, 40 e 55 days after germination and were fixed in FPA 50. These plants are phanerocotylars and epigeous with tap and diarch root. The hypocotyl has transition structure between root and stem, being separated and spreading cells from primary xylem, arranged around of parenchyma pith. Phloem keeps undivided. At the beginning of epicotyls two vascular bundles are formed. The 55 day old seedlings secondary growth is notorious in the root basal region, hypocotyl and epicotyl. Cotyledons, eophylls and metaphylls present uniseriate epidermis on both faces. Cotyledons are amphihypostomatic and eophylls and metaphylls are hypostomatic, all of them have dorsiventral mesophyll. The cotyledon midrib is not prominent with a bundle. The midrib is prominent and it has five collaterals bundle in the eophyll and seven in the metaphyll. The three leaves have different petiole formats, subepidermic collenchyma, two collateral vascular bundles ones in the cotyledon and ten in the eophyll and metaphyll.},

The analyses were proceeding from capture data of N. brasiliensis collected on the continental shelf off Babitonga Bay (26°S). The species has its constant abundance during all seasons, being represented by individuals in different phases of life cycle. It can predominantly be characterized as resident of the area, being distributed between 10 and 20 m in depths. A standard was observed which reflects the preference of occupation of shallow waters (10 m), during the summer. In autumn/2006 and winter/2006 the species concentrate in 20 m, presenting higher latitudinal and longitudinal distribution. Considering the totality of N. brasiliensis distribution area, highlighting its constant abundance during the studied period, the population ontogenetic composition and the propitious hydrological features generated by fluvial systems of Baía da Babitonga, it can be suggested that the north coast of the State of Santa Catarina, constitutes N. brasiliensis nursery and grow area in south Brazil.},

	abstract = {Suicide tends to occur in families, and parental psychopathology has been linked to offspring suicidal behaviors. This study explores the influence of parental mental disorders across the lifespan. Data are from the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey, a crosssectional household study with a representative sample of the adult population living in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil (N=2,942). Survival models examined bivariate and multivariate associations between a range of parental disorders and offspring suicidality. After controlling for comorbidity, number of mental disorders and offspring psychopathology, we found that parental psychopathology influences suicidal behaviors throughout most part of the life cycle, from childhood until young adult years. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and antisocial personality were associated with offspring suicidal ideation (OR 1.8 and 1.9, respectively), panic and GAD predicted suicidal attempts (OR 2.3 and 2.7, respectively), and panic was related to the transition from ideation to attempts (OR 2.7). Although noticed in many different stages of the lifespan, this influence is most evident during adolescence. In this period, depression and antisocial personality increased the odds of suicidal ideation (OR 5.1 and 3.2, respectively), and depression, panic disorder, GAD and substance abuse predicted suicidal attempts (OR varying from 1.7 to 3.8). In short, parental disorders characterized by impulsive-aggression and anxiety-agitation were the main predictors of offspring suicidality across the lifespan. This clinically relevant intergenerational transmission of suicide risk was independent of offspring mental disorders, and this underscores the need for a family approach to psychopathology.

	abstract = {Objective To assess how well the Aedes aegypti infestation rapid survey, Levantamento Rapido de Indice para Aedes aegypti (LIRAa), is able to accurately estimate dengue vector densities and target the most important breeding sites in Goiania, Brazil. Methods In February 2009, a pupal productivity survey was conducted in 2 districts of the city of Goiania, central Brazil. The results were compared to those of LIRAas conducted in the same districts during the months before and after the pupal productivity survey. Results In the pupal productivity survey, 2024 houses were surveyed and 2969 water-holding containers were inspected. Discarded small water containers most frequently contained immature Ae. aegypti. The most pupal-productive containers were elevated water tanks, roof gutters and water holding roofs. Combined, these three containers accounted for <40% of all positive containers but produced >70% of all pupae. In the two districts where the pupal productivity survey was conducted, the house indices were 5.1 and 4.6 and the Breteau indices were 5.9 and 6.0. In contrast, the two LIRAs conducted in the same two districts resulted in an average house index of 1.5 and Breteau index of 2.5, with discarded items identified as the most frequently infested container type. Conclusion Both the LIRAa and the pupal productivity survey identified discarded items as being most frequently infested with immature stages of Ae. aegypti, but the pupal productivity survey showed that elevated containers produced the greatest proportion of Ae. aegypti pupae (a proxy measure of adult vector density) and that the values of the Stegomyia indices were substantially underestimated by LIRAa. Although both surveys differ considerably in terms of sampling method and manpower, in the case of this study the LIRAa did not accurately identify or target the containers that were the most important to adult mosquito production. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objectives The elimination of Aedes aegypti breeding sites has been broadly adopted worldwide to keep vector population density below a critical threshold. We observed the effectiveness of targeting the most productive containers on adult A. aegypti females density, which was evaluated weekly. Methods and Results Adult mosquitoes were collected weekly over 55weeks and pupal surveys were done in intervals of 4months to determine container productivity and guidelines for interventions. Pupal surveys indicated that water tanks (72% of pupae in first survey) and metal drums (30.7% of pupae in second survey) were the most productive container types. We observed a dramatic but short-term decrease in weekly adult female A. aegypti density after covering 733 water tanks with nylon net. A long-term decrease in female adult population density was achieved only when we covered both water tanks and metal drums. Overall, pupae abundance and pupae standing crop diminished after netting water tanks and metal drums. Pupae per person, per hectare and per house decreased gradually between the first and the third pupal surveys, suggesting that targeting the most productive container types (water tanks and metal drums) produced a reduction in adult population density and infestation levels. Conclusion Overall, targeting the most productive container types caused the adult mosquito density to decrease over time, supporting the assumption that this intervention is an effective tool for dengue control. However, this effect was observed only when both water tanks and metal drums were covered, possibly due to the functional similarity between these container types, which are large, often shaded, perennial water storage containers. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate: (1) the occurrence, maintenance, productivity, spatial distribution and premise condition index score of Adese aegypti-infested houses and key-premises in a suburban district (Tubiacanga) and a slum (Favela do Amorim) of Rio de Janeiro and (2) the role of these factors in adult Ae. aegypti female spatial distribution. Methods and Results: A total of 2456 premises were inspected for immature and 1100 for adult collection. Key-premises corresponded to 16.08% and 17.86% of infested houses in Tubiacanga, and 13.5% and 11.1% in Favela do Amorim, during the dry and wet seasons, respectively. Key-premises held significantly more immature Ae. aegypti, pupae and larvae than infested houses in Favela do Amorim and Tubiacanga during the dry and wet seasons. In Favela do Amorim, key-premises had a significantly higher PCI score than infested but non-key houses. Conclusion: The spatial distribution of key-premises and adult Ae. aegypti females was often congruent, indicating that key-premises influence the infestation pattern observed in the study areas. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The Brazilian government has started up a large social housing program for low-income families. Considering the large investment for this program, it is important to analyse the environmental impact to create a base for further improvement assessment. The goal of this paper is to visualise the energy use (embodied and operational) during the life cycle of case study for a house in the social housing program. The case study showed that the embodied energy (EE) is 7.2 GJ/m2 or 30% of the total energy from the life cycle, the operational energy is 17.5 GJ/m2. Half of the Embodied Energy is due to material use for maintenance and around 57% of the embodied energy is used in the wall construction. Compared to other international studies (5.8 GJ/m 2 per 50 years), the embodied energy is relative high (7.2 GJ/m 2 per 50 years) whereas the operational energy is only the half (17.5 compared to 36 GJ/m2 per 50 year). The study indicates that the largest improvement potential for reducing the embodied energy is connected to the walls trough choosing materials and systems with less Embodied Energy and higher durability to decrease the need for maintenance and substitution of materials. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: This work was an epidemiological investigation of the risk of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in the rural Quilombola community of Furnas do Dionízio, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: Of the 71 animals examined, seven were captured (two opossums, Didelphis albiventris; four rats, Rattus rattus; and one nine-banded armadillo, Dasypus novemcinctus) and 64 were domestic (one canine, Canis familiaris; five pigs, Sus scrofa; two bovines, Bos taurus; five caprines, Capra sp.; and 51 ovines, Ovis aries). Parasitological tests were performed to detect parasites in the blood and to identify the morphology of flagellates. These methods included fresh examinations, buffy coat tests and blood cultures. Molecular analysis of DNA for identification of trypanosomatids was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers S35 and S36. Results: The parasitological tests showed flagellates in an opossum and two cattle. The molecular tests showed DNA from T. cruzi in an opossum and a pig. Triatoma sordida was the only triatomine species found in the community, and it colonized households (four specimens) and the surrounding areas (124 specimens). Twentythree specimens tested positive for flagellates, which were subsequently identified as T. cruzi by PCR. Conclusions: Data analysis demonstrated that T. cruzi has a peridomestic life cycle that involves both domestic and wild mammals.},

	abstract = {The human cases of eosinophilic meningitis recently reported from Brazil have focused the attention of the public health agencies on the role the introduced snail Achatina fulica plays as hosts of the metastrongylid nematodes. Determining the potential of this snail to host and develop infective larval stages of metastrongylids in the wild and identify the species harbored by them is crucial for designing effective control measures. Here we assess if A. fulica may act as intermediate host of A. cantonensis at the peridomiciliary areas of a patient's house from state of Pernambuco (PE), who was diagnosed with eosinophilic meningitis and a history of ingesting raw molluscs. Larvae obtained from naturally infected A. fulica were orally administered to Rattus norvegicus. The worms were collected from the pulmonary artery and brain, and were morphologically characterized and compared to the Japan isolate of A. cantonensis. Adult worms and infective L3 larvae (PE isolate) recovered from A. fulica specimens were also analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism of ITS2 region from rDNA and compared to A. cantonensis (ES isolate), A. vasorum (MG isolate) and A. costaricensis (RS isolate). The large size of the spicules (greater than those observed in other species of Angiostrongylus) and the pattern of the bursal rays agree with the original species description by Chen (1935). Furthermore, the morphology of the PE isolate was similar to that of Japan isolate. The PCR-RFLP profiles obtained were distinctive among species and no variation in patterns was detected among adult individuals from A. cantonensis isolates from PE and ES. The importance of A. fulica as an intermediate host of eosinophilic menigoencepahlitis in Brazil is emphasized. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Age structure and hatchling dates of the squid Illex argentinus collected by bottom-trawl fishery in southern Brazilian waters were assessed by the analysis of statolith growth increments. Catches occurred between 2001 and 2002, from 23° to 32°S at depths of 100-700Â m. Squid from juvenile to post-spawning stages were collected year round, with age estimated from 98 to 320 days and mantle lengths ranging from 112 to 376Â mm. Duration of life cycle events based on statolith growth zones revealed that squids can spend about 14% of their lifespan as paralarva (~30 days), 70% as juvenile (~130 days), leaving maturity and spawning condition to the terminal 10-20% (~30-60 days). The results suggest that, unlike estimates available for Patagonian populations, a general 0.5 year lifespan is predicted for I. argentinus off Brazil. The wide range of size-at-ages implied that catches of shortfin squid off southern Brazil probably include squid hatched throughout the year. Mature and spawning squid caught in summer months hatched in winter and spring, while winter catches revealed mature-spawning individuals hatched both in summer/autumn (~6 months of age) and winter/spring periods (~10-11 months of age). It has been argued that such groups may combine both squid resident of Brazilian outer shelf and slope (22°-34°S) with a six months' lifespan and migrating squid originated from the northern Patagonian shelf (~42°S) with 10-11 months' lifespan.

	abstract = {Resident fishes and their seasonal use of a surf zone were characterized and identified in the Jaguaribe beach, located on the Island of Itamaracá, state of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Monthly towings (March 2006 to February 2007) with a beach seine net (20 m long, 1.5 m high, 5 mm mesh size) in different moon phases and periods of the day (day and night) were conducted. A total of 6,407 specimens, 35 families and 90 species were recorded. Seven species were considered as annual residents (Anchoa tricolor, Anchoviella lepidentostole, Bairdiella ronchus, Larimus breviceps, Lycengraulis grossidens, Polydactylus virginicus and Pomadasys corvinaeformis), three resident throughout the dry season (Conodon nobilis, Lile piquitinga and Menticirrhus americanus) and two resident species in the rainy period (Cathorops spixii and Nicholsina usta). Among these 12 species, concerning their life cycle, three of them (A. tricolor, C. spixii and L. piquitinga) showed only adult individuals, while B. ronchus, M. americanus and N. usta were the only species represented exclusively by juvenile in both seasons. The surf zone of Jaguaribe beach presents a considerable ecological importance as it encompasses a great diversity of fishes, including species considered rare for this ecosystem, as well as species which are resident annually or seasonally. The distribution pattern of species found in this study shows that the ichthyofauna of the surf zone in Jaguaribe beach is rich, mainly dominated by small-sized individuals including juveniles of several species, with the presence of some species most commonly found in neighboring environments, such as seagrass beds, estuaries and reefs. As an integrated component of interconnected environments in coastal areas of Pernambuco, and owing to its function in the life cycle of coastal fishes, the surf zone of Jaguartibe beach presents an apparently common ecological pattern for tropical sandy beaches.},

	abstract = {Marked heterogeneity exists in the patterns of parasitic infection between individuals, households and communities. Analysis of parasite distributions within populations is complicated by the fact that parasite distributions are highly aggregated and few studies have explicitly incorporated this distribution when investigating small-scale spatial heterogeneities. This study aimed to quantify the small-scale (within- and between-household) heterogeneity of helminth infection in an area of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, with rural and urban sectors. Parasitological data from a cross-sectional survey of 1,249 individuals aged 0-86 years from 242 households were analysed. Within-household clustering of infection was assessed using random effect logistic regression models and between-household spatial heterogeneity was assessed using a Bayesian negative binomial spatial model. The overall prevalence of hookworm (Necator americanus) was 66.9%, the prevalence of Schistosoma mansoni was 44.9% and the prevalence of Ascaris lumbricoides was 48.8%. Statistical analysis indicated significant (within) household and (between household) spatial clustering of hookworm in both rural and urban areas and of S. mansoni in rural areas. There was no evidence of either household or spatial clustering of S. mansoni in urban areas. The spatial correlation of S. mansoni was estimated to reduce by half over a distance of 700 m in the rural area. Rural hookworm had a much smaller half-distance (28 m) and urban hookworm showed an even smaller half-distance (12 m). We suggest that such species-specific differences in patterns of infection by environment are primarily due to variation in exposure and parasite life cycle, although host genetic factors cannot be ruled out. © 2006 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.},

	abstract = {The objective of this article is to describe the family arrangements most vulnerable to impoverishment in the metropolitan regions of Brazil and to investigate the access of very poor families to such programs, as well as some of their effects on the earnings of these families. The household arrangements most vulnerable to impoverishment are those with the lowest per capita family income and those in the lowest income deciles. They show varying family structures and compositions and go through different moments in their family life cycles, but they are the hardest hit in terms of changes in employment patterns, since their family compositions are unfavorable for their members to enter the labor market. The impoverishment of households in the Brazilian metropolitan regions during the 1990s and the first years of the 21st century reflects the fall in income from work, due to the unstable job market that resulted from the restructuring of production and the country's low economic growth until 2004. Even by 2006, with economic improvements, these earnings failed to return to the levels of the mid-1990s. Among the policies set up in the government's "fight against poverty," one resource was the income transfer program, which was quite limited in the first years of the new century. It was intensified during the decade, enabling easier access to low-income households. By presenting a comparative analysis between the data from the PNADs of 2004 and 2006, we seek in this article to identify the access to such programs by households characterized by different types of family arrangements, considering their structures and the stage in the families' life cycle. One of the impacts to be investigated is the fall in the number of households with zero income. The lower inequality in income among the most vulnerable family arrangements, as well as among other types, are also discussed, and it is noted that there continue to be differences in per capita income.},

Secondary issues examined include stakeholder theory and life cycle stages in business development. The case has a difficulty level of three, appropriate for junior level courses and higher. The case is designed to be taught in two classes of 3 hours and is expected to require 2 hours of outside preparation by student. Case Synopsis: Ilha Grande, a exotic, natural island located in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest off the coast of Brazil, has faced a series of challenges throughout history. However, the most serious threats to the sustainability of the island might be occurring now. From environmental threats such as increases in tourist visitation to invasive species and proximity to a nuclear plant to socio-cultural issues such as inequalities among residents and non residents with regard to education, loss of culture, land use and well being to economic issues such as lack of employment and income, Ilha Grande is at a crossroad in its opportunity towards sustainable development. This island became a tourism destination only 20 years ago in 1994. As the 3rd most popular island destination in all of South America, Ilha Grande has the promise of a vibrant tourism industry because of its beautiful beaches, protected areas and biological reserves. This case study will outline the history of Ilha Grande and how tourism evolved despite the lack of infrastructure, overdevelopment, lack of qualified personnel, over abundance of tourists who arrive by boats and by cruise ships, the encroachment of oil drilling in the bay and the proximity of Brazil's two nuclear energy plants. Students will read and view the positions of various stakeholders. This includes business owners, local residents, new residents (outsiders), tourists, oil exploration companies, government, cruise ships, and environmentalists. Using the perspectives of the various stakeholders, student will be asked to prepare a plan for sustainable tourism development.},

	abstract = {The life cycle of vectors and the reservoirs that participate in the chain of infectious diseases have a strong relationship with the environmental dynamics of the ecosystems in which they live. Oscillations in population abundance and seasonality of insects can be explained by factors inherent in each region and time period. Therefore, knowledge of the relationship and influence of environmental factors on the population of Lutzomyia longipalpis is necessary because of the high incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Brazil. This study evaluates the influence of abiotic variables on the population density and seasonal behavior of L. longipalpis in an urban endemic area of VL in Brazil. The sand fly captures were performed every two months between November, 2009 and November, 2010 in the peridomicile of 13 randomly selected residences. We captured 1,367 specimens of L. longipalpis, and the ratio of male/female flies was 2.86:1. The comparison of the total male specimens in the two seasons showed a statistical difference in the wet season, but there was no significant difference when considering the total females. With respect to climatic variables, a significant negative association was observed only with wind speed. During periods of high wind speeds, the population density of this vector decreased. The presence of L. longipalpis was found in all months of the study with bimodal behavior and population peaks during the wet season. © 2013 The Society for Vector Ecology.},

	abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to propose a set of lifecycle-based indicators to describe material eco-efficiency of buildings normalized per unit of gross floor area (GFA), and at verifying feasibility of their calculation for building materials and components, based upon four case studies. The paper also examines the effects that discrepancies between two carbon footprint accounting methods (embodied CO2 (ECO2) vs embodied CO2e) have on communication of environmental performance of selected materials. Design/methodology/approach – The lifecycle assessments (LCAs) were performed through LCA support platform SimaPro 7.3. Data for materials/components production cycle modeling were collected from primary and secondary data from national literature or adapted from Ecoinvent database. Embodied energy, ECO2, blue water footprint (bWF), non-renewable content and volatile organic compound emissions (VOCe) indicators were calculated from lifecycle inventory (LCI) outputs, while embodied CO2e was calculated using CML 2001 v.2.01 impact assessment method. Findings – Obtained results suggest that a core database comprised of 12 materials and components – cement, ceramic blocks, steel rebar, sawn timber planks, PVC tubes, plywood, PVC conduits, roof steel structure, roundwood, ceramic tiles, hydrated lime and adhesive mortar – provides a very reasonable description of a building’s embodied energy (99.63 percent), embodied CO2e (97.50 percent), bWF (96.26 percent), non-renewable content (97.53 percent) and VOCe (95.38 percent) profiles. Except for bWF of cement and concrete, substantial reductions in the metrics’ values captured environmental advantages of partially substituting ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) for clinker Portland. Originality/value – The disclosure of embodied energy and carbon, as well as of other environmental performance data at whole-building level (per unit of GFA) pointed out in this paper, allows comparability and helps to establish performance goals and benchmarks and to guide policy decisions. Following a coordinated methodological outline, future works are expected to evolve to gradually constitute a LCI database that enables the use of the proposed metrics and of LCA as decision-making tools in the building sector. © 2014 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

This paper discusses the basic flaws in present thinking models of residents and municipal administrators. Fundamental arguments presented on municipal solid waste relate to nomenclature, destinations, definitions, logistics, social dynamics, social assistance programs, education and employment philosophies. In each case, the consequences of the stalemate are explained in terms of the unsustainable situation of constantly growing landfills. In sequence, a proactive thinking model is presented and explained that has the potential of drastically reducing landfill size. It is called Municipal Transit Material Processing. The model has been tested successfully in small communities and is now available for scale-up. The landfill diversion achieved stands at 62% of household waste in comparison with 15% theoretically possible in Brazil with selective collection models. Although of necessity the arguments apply directly to Brazil, the basic ideas behind the reasoning may be extrapolated to other Southern countries. The following simple example will illustrate to the reader the type of paradigm inversion the paper proposes to convey. The classical political slogan in Brazil is "get children out of garbage dumps". The inversion proposed and explained is "do away with garbage dumps". © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

	abstract = {This paper is about studies on the relationships between environment and population from an integrated perspective, and changes in the use of the land cover, focusing on the contributions and challenges for demography. Demography approached this issue in the mid-1990s and its main contribution was to highlight the importance of population components in the models, which, until then, had been presented mainly from a simple perspective and as secondary components. Although Brazilian demographers dedicated to environmental issues were studying primarily urban themes, they collaborated indirectly to the field by proposing new ways of thinking about relations between population and environment. This paper is based on the Brazilian Amazon Region and shows how the population has been considered in theories about changes in the uses and cover of the land. Growth related to the expansion of the agricultural frontiers has also been treated, as well as the model of the household life cycle (fertility and household composition) in the 1990s and, more recently, a focus on the migration component. For demography, the article argues how essential it is to broaden studies on demographic elements, rather than their volume and space, and its effects. For the construction of Land Change Science, the author insists on the importance of urban dynamics in research, the adoption of a methodology and the exercise of dialogue among the various fields of study, incorporating the contribution of demography more systematically.},

It presents methodology based on interviews and personal observations at construction sites in Brazil, using nine case studies in Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil. The results from the analyzed construction sites show that sustainable practices are incipient and still unsatisfactory.

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a summary of the current knowledge of Lycengraulis grossidens, a widely distributed coastal fish that occurs from Belize to Argentina. This species is abundant in estuaries along the Southwest Atlantic Coast and is important for recreational fishing, and as bycatch of shrimp fisheries. We compiled data available on taxonomy, phylogeny, ecology, fisheries and organized conceptually the life cycle of the species according to modern estuarine-use classification. Our review showed that along its geographic distribution and inside some particular environments (i.e., estuaries and costal lagoons) the species have been classified in a variety of ways in order to describe the remarkable complexity of habitat use that varies from freshwater resident, anadromous, marine migrant, estuarine resident, marine stragglers, catadromous to semi-catadromous. We conclude that L. grossidens is able to reproduce either in freshwater or estuarine water and postulate that it has a high plasticity in habitat use and life history, with migratory and resident contingents in the same local population. There seems to be a latitudinal change in migratory behavior of this species along the South America Coast, prevailing anadromous or semi-anadromous pattern at higher latitudes and marine migrants at the tropical northeast coast of Brazil.},

The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii and anti-Neospora caninum antibodies in 170 free-living capybaras in a residential park area in Itu Municipality, São Paulo State, Brazil. Serum samples were tested by indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for T. gondii (IFAT ≥ 1:16) and N. caninum (IFAT ≥ 1:50). Among the 170 samples analyzed, 10% (17/170) and 0% (0/170) were seropositive for T. gondii and N. caninum, respectively. This study confirms the widespread presence of T. gondii and reinforces the role of capybaras in the life cycle of this parasite.

	abstract = {The major problem on geotechnical work is to ensure that no settlements occur during the life cycle of the construction. This involves proper design of foundations and their bearing capacity. The Brazilian standard for design and execution of foundations, ABNT (2010) NBR 6122 imposes the utilization of field tests when designing building foundations. The Standard Penetration Test, SPT, ABNT (2001) NBR 6484, is still the most common in-situ test for those purposes. Ranzini (1988) suggested supplementing the conventional SPT with the measurement of the torque (SPT-T) required to turn the split spoon after driving, in order to provide a ‘static’ component to a ‘dynamic’ test. The adhesion between the soil and the sampler, obtained by the torque measurement, could be used to calculate the lateral skin friction of piles. This paper describes the SPT-T procedure including both a supplementary equipment and practical aspects. Also it presents an accurate torque measurement, a prediction method to calculate the bearing capacity of piles used in building foundations using the SPT-T test and a comparison between the estimated bearing capacities of building foundations with instrumented load tests in order to validate the method. © 2014 Acta Scientiarum.

Given this, discussions on environmental suitability of the sector become relevant, since it is recognized as the most important sector for achieving more sustainable patterns of development. The life cycle assessment (LCA) has been considered one of the most appropriate methodologies for the analysis of interactions between products and services of construction industry and the environment and it has been used with numerous goals and different methodological referrals. In Brazil the main limitation related to the use of LCA is the lack of databases for the specific regional reality, which is related with life cycle inventories, part of LCA process. This article aims to compare different LCA studies that addressed the life cycle of ceramic bricks, an intensive used component in Brazilian's buildings. The focus defined is the LCI of production phase, identifying possible differences in modeling processes and in inputs and outputs. The results pointed out to homogeneity in process description and to a lack of correspondence of inputs and outputs with functional units adopted. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

The environmental and investment feasibility analysis was performed for two scenarios, i.e., a scenario in which there is only a potable water system supplied by the water utility, and another scenario in which the potable water system is complemented by rainwater. Three types of rainwater storage tanks were analysed: plastic reinforced with glass fibre, high density polyethylene and reinforced concrete. Results indicate that plastic tanks reinforced with glass fibre are environmentally more feasible, while concrete tanks are economically more feasible. This study showed the importance of analysing environmental and economic aspects before implementing a system with rainwater utilization; thus better choices regarding the materials used in the systems, aiming at sustainability in buildings, can be made. © 2011 WIT Press.},

	abstract = {The medically important spiders Loxosceles intermedia Mello-Leitão and Loxosceles laeta (Nicolet) are segregated in Curitiba, southern Brazil, where L. intermedia is more abundant and widespread than L. laeta. Because they share similar microhabitat preferences and wander in search of web sites, agonistic encounters are likely to occur. The purposes of this study were to describe agonistic interactions and interpret their consequences for the relative abundances and spatial segregation of L. intermedia and L. laeta. Experimental contests were performed between residents and intruders. Asymmetries between contestants included sex, age, species, weight, and residence status. Nine behavioral categories were defined. Through discriminant analyses, it was possible to differentiate spider sex, species, and residence based on their agonistic behaviors. Intruders, juveniles, and L. intermedia individuals were better characterized by exploratory behaviors, whereas L. Laeta females were differentiated by aggressiveness. By performing a multiple logistic regression, with winning or defeat as a dependent variable of sex, age, species, size, weight, and residence, it was possible to say that residents and L. intermedia individuals had the highest winning odds in contests,whereas juveniles had lower winning odds than adults. Advantages of the prior residence may help to explain the predominance of L. Laeta in old colonization sites, whereas the higher winning odds of L. intermedia and less aggressive behavior toward conspecifics may lead to a successful establishment of dense populations in new sites. A better understanding of agonistic interactions as a mechanism of spacing, segregation, and species replacement among spiders may be helpful for control purposes. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.},

In Brazil the species is aggressive to humans and animals. Nymphs and adults of O. mimon were collected from the roof of a residence in Araraquara, São Paulo, Brazil, whose residents were bitten by ticks. Once in the laboratory, they were fed on rabbits and maintained in biological oxygen demand incubator at 27 ± 1 °C and 90 ± 10 % relative humidity. The females, after mating, laid eggs that resulted in larvae that were identified by the original description and also by the paratypes examination (RML 50271-50274) deposited at the United State National Tick Collection, Georgia, GA, USA. The life cycle of this species was obtained through the acquisition of two generations of ticks (F1 and F2) in the laboratory using rodents and rabbits as hosts. The biological parameters of larva, nymph and adult stages of both generations were recorded from infestations of the laboratory hosts. Larvae showed a profile of feeding for days on the host, whereas the nymphs and adults fed only for few minutes. First nymphal instar (N1) molted to second nymphal instar (N2) without blood meal. The species life cycle was elucidated for the first time. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

	abstract = {The author’s research and practical experience with municipal solid waste management have shown the urgent need for new thinking models. Present paradigms are stalemate. They do not allow for flexible approaches to solving an extremely dynamic problem. This paper discusses the basic flaws in present thinking models of residents, municipal administrators and even scholars. Fundamental arguments presented on municipal solid waste relate to nomenclature, destinations, definitions, logistics, social dynamics, social assistance programs, education and employment philosophies. In each case, the consequences of the stalemate are explained in terms of the unsustainable situation of constantly growing landfills. In sequence, proactive thinking models are presented and explained that lead to drastic reduction of landfill size. Several of these models have been tested successfully in small communities and are now available for scale-up. Although of necessity the arguments and models apply directly to Brazil, the basic ideas behind the reasoning may be extrapolated. © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {Urbanization drastically alters natural ecosystems and the structure of their plant and animal communities. Whereas some species cope successfully with these environmental changes, others may go extinct. In the case of parasite communities, the expansion of urban areas has a critical effect by changing the availability of suitable substrates for the eggs or free-larval stages of those species with direct life cycles or for the range of hosts of those species with complex cycles. In this study we investigated the influence of the degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity on helminth richness, abundance and community structure of rufous-bellied thrushes (Turdus rufiventris) along a rural-urban gradient in the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This common native bird species of southern Brazil hosts 15 endoparasite species at the study region. A total of 144 thrushes were collected with mist nets at 11 sites. The degree of urbanization and environmental heterogeneity were estimated by quantifying five landscape elements: buildings, woodlands, fields, bare lands, and water. Landscape analyses were performed at two spatial scales (10 and 100 ha) taking into account home range size and the potential dispersal distance of thrushes and their prey (intermediate hosts). Mean parasite richness showed an inverse relationship with the degree of urbanization, but a positive relationship with environmental heterogeneity. Changes in the structure of component communities along the rural-urban gradient resulted from responses to the availability of particular landscape elements that are compatible with the parasites' life cycles. We found that the replacement of natural environments with buildings breaks up host-parasite interactions, whereas a higher environmental (substrate) diversity allows the survival of a wider range of intermediate hosts and vectors and their associated parasites. © 2014 Calegaro-Marques, Amato.},

	abstract = {The Abrolhos reefs are the largest and the richest coral reefs of Brazil, where corals, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and vermetids are the main reef-building organisms. In the Abrolhos Archipelago, the vermetid Dendropoma irregulare (d'Orbigny, 1842) associated with the CCA Porolithon pachydermum (Foslie) Foslie, represents a significant portion of the reef edges. This study aimed to analyze the seasonal influence of the substrate and hydrodynamic exposure to vermetid D. irregulare settlement, and to verify if the biological cues might be acting in the vermetid settlement. Seasonal in situ settlement experiments were performed, testing different substrata (live coralline algae, dead coralline algae, and artificial substrate) in three study sites (Mato Verde, Caldeiros, and Siriba) and a seasonal exposure index was calculated. We found that P. pachydermum enhance settlement of D. irregulare in the Abrolhos reefs. The vermetid settlements were significantly higher on (1) substrates with live CCA, and (2) in the presence of substrates with live CCA cues. The highest vermetid settlements, which best reveal the positive effect of substrate cues (live coralline algae), were observed at Siriba during summer and autumn-winter, being more than twice that recorded in Mato Verde. It is suggested that features associated with live coralline surfaces may attract the settlement of the juvenile vermetid. This study revealed a significant positive correlation between settlements of the vermetid on live CCA and the degree of exposure to hydrodynamics, where the highest densities were observed in a moderate condition of exposure. Responses to the preferential settlement on live coralline algae surfaces in the present study are probably due to a complex of cues acting simultaneously, which includes the physical (hydrodynamics) and biological cues (biofilms). This study provides the first attempt to examination of the settlement factors of the vermetids, contributing to the role that live coralline may play as "nursery habitats" in the Abrolhos Archipelago. Because of its ability to induce settlement of the crawling juvenile vermetid, CCA play a fundamental role in the life cycle of many marine invertebrates, including D. irregulare. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Solar water heating systems are widely used in Brazil for domestic purposes in single-family households. The exploitation of the potential energy of the water from the upper tank and the thermosyphon phenomena for hot water circulation constitutes the absolute majority of the residential solar water heating systems in the country. But, these water heating systems are usually sized according to tables provided by the manufacturers, which show the number of plates required based on the size of the family and the number of hot water outlets. This sizing is based much more on intuition rather than on scientific data. For that reason, this work has developed an optimization model for water heating systems design parameters, using a numerical simulation routine, in a long-term transient regime. The optimized design gives the slope and area of the flat plate collector, which results in the minimum cost over the equipment life cycle. The computing procedure was executed considering specific characteristics of the project. A thermosyphon solar water heating system with flat-plate collector for Sao Paulo's climate was simulated. The practice of Brazilian designers and manufacturers is to recommend the maximization of the energetic gain for the winter. This paper has analyzed in economic terms if it is more attractive to increase the gain of solar energy in the winter period, with the consequence of reduction of the solar energy gain along the year, or to adopt the adequate slope, which improves the yearly solar energy gain. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Most life cycle assessments have focused on impacts associated with the energy efficiency of buildings, in particular during the operational phase. However, the construction phase of buildings accounts for a significant share of a building's embodied energy and is responsible for impacts related to resource depletion. With the aim to contribute to more all-embracing assessments in the construction sector, this study aims to compare three different wall types commonly used in Brazil, according to their environmental performances: ceramic brick, concrete brick and cast-in-place reinforced concrete exterior walls. The results were analyzed with the software SimaPro 7.3 and with the life cycle impact assessment method IMPACT 2002+ (version Q2.2). Ceramic brick walls have less impact than the concrete brick and the cast-in-place reinforced concrete exterior walls on three different endpoint indicators (Climate Change, Resource Depletion and Water Withdrawal). The results were not significant regarding impacts on Human Health and Ecosystem Quality. Different sensitivity analyses were carried out in order to test the final results, as well as uncertainty analysis, related to the variability of inventory data and the characterization of the life cycle inventory results into midpoints and/or endpoints. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

In 2007 they launched the ‘Mais Eu’ (More me) social campaign aligned with the business, aiming to increase women’s professional qualifications, job and income generation. The key concern relied upon the content of the communication, in order to promote a deep adaptation to regional tastes and habits, respecting the different lifestyles. The institutional advertising campaign focused on the concept of woman and her relationship with important symbols such as family, considering different phases of her life-cycle (teenager, mother with children, and housewife in her home routine) and different women’s styles. This approach nationalized the concept and the importance of women from all Brazilian regions, enabling identification and awareness. The objectives of this paper are: (a) to present the campaign, as it could serve as a model to be replicated by other companies, in emergent or developing countries; and (b) to analyze the campaign using the theoretical framework of the Ethics of Care. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

	abstract = {Brazil is one of the few countries where the water heating for bath is performed by using electric showerheads. The widespread use of these devices is the mainly responsible for the high peak on the electricity demand of the residential sector, observed between 18:00 and 21:00 hours. As a consequence of that, costs and service quality are undermined, affecting consumers and the electricity sector in general. In attempt to deal with this issue, solar hot water systems have been proposed as an option to reduce the electricity consumption of the showerheads. However, despite of the high incidence of solar radiation on the Brazilian territory indicates a significant economy, currently there is no technical assessment quantifying the economic benefits on the region. The present study estimates the economic impacts resulting by the deployment of solar hot water systems in Brazilian households. Hence, the feasibility study allows assessing the potential of solar water heating as alternative to reduce the peak on the electricity demand in Brazil. In order to perform the proposed analysis, long-term performance simulations were performed on an hourly basis using the TRNSYS software as computational tool and typical meteorological year (TMY) files as input data. The TRNSYS component (Type 45) relating the solar water heating equipment had been experimentally validated, whereas the weather data was obtained from the SWERA database. Also, a time dependent profile of the heating demand is considered, according the measurements collected in previous studies. The thermal performance is evaluated in terms of solar fraction. On the other hand, the economic impacts are quantified in terms of three criteria for economic feasibility, such as payback period, internal rate of return and life cycle savings. In order to explore the benefits arising from different policies, four tariff scenarios are considered. The economic evaluation is positive over all scenarios analyzed, showing savings for both, the consumers and the electricity sector. The results of this analysis can be used as support tool for target setting the adoption or spread the use solar water heaters, or even to create policies for its diffusion. © 2014 The Authors Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {We describe how hookworms interact with their human hosts by comparing lymphocyte phenotyping, proliferative responses, and cytokine and chemokine secretion patterns in adults who are either mono-infected with Necator americanus or egg-negative controls resident in an area of high transmission in Brazil. Cellular immune responses against crude hookworm antigen extracts from different developmental stages were evaluated simultaneously. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the standardized immune responses. Random effects multivariate regression was then used to investigate whether principal components (PC) differ between the two groups once potential confounders and effect modifiers have been accounted for. Although hookworm patients had reduced percentages of T and B cells, they had higher levels of activated CD4+ T and CD19+ B cells. This state of 'immune activation' coincided with lower proliferative responses, especially to third-stage larval antigen. Cytokine levels in mono-infected adults were also lower and characterized by a mixed Th1/Th2-type profile. Excretory/secretory antigen from adult worms was a potent modulator of the immune response, resulting in diminished TNF-α and IL-10 secretion in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hookworm infected patients. We propose that the longevity of hookworms in their human hosts results from a stage-specific, down-modulation of the immune response. © 2007 The Authors.},

In this work, we introduce a conceptual framework and a mathematical model to simulate the time evolution of the energy balance of energy conversion technologies. This approach complements static energy return analyses. It is based on a few technical parameters that describe a standard conversion module, a set of deployment objectives, and assumed growth rates for deployment. It is independent of working details of the conversion technology. A set of equations is formulated and solved to model the deployment of the new technology. It allows for evaluation of gross and net produced energy and for estimation of required investments. The model is applied to photovoltaic electricity in Brazil, wind electricity globally and in Brazil, and sugar cane bioethanol. The main conclusions are: (i) photovoltaic electricity, because it requires large energy investments, leads to negative net production of electricity for many years, i.e., for an extended period it is an energy sink and not source; (ii) wind electricity is an attractive option is terms of net electricity production; (iii) sugar cane bioethanol is an attractive option for liquid fuels production for the world. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Austrolebias genus comprises about 40 small annual killifishes endemic to South America and their highest diversity occurs in southern Brazil and Uruguay, especially in drainages of Patos-Mirim system. Austrolebias species are severely threatened with extinction because their life cycle and restricted ranges. Low dispersal ability and the extensive loss and fragmentation of freshwater wetlands contribute to this threat. Accurate information on the geographic distribution and ecology of the species, vital to plan conservation and management strategies, are scarce. In order to provide basic knowledge for annual fish conservation this paper reports the presence of Austrolebias cheradophilus and present data about its population structure (CPUA, size, sex ratio, length-weight relationships and condition factor) and conservation status in southern Brazil. The estimated CPUA of populations was 0.86 fish/m2. Standard length (SL) of males ranged between 32.14 and 49.17 mm and for females between 25.11 and 41.6 mm. There were no differences in SL between the sexes (t-test = - 1.678; P = 0.105), and Chi-squared test demonstrated marginal differences in proportions of sexes (2.25:1; χ2 = 3.846; P = 0.07). Allometric coefficient of the LWR was slightly hyperallometric (b = 3.08) and K of the specimens ranged from 1.84 to 2.42 (mean ± S.E. = 2.12 ± 0.04). Populations have low density and their biotopes are under critical threat, mainly due to suppression by agriculture, pastures for livestock and increase housing. The species is considered "Critically Endangered" in Brazil, furthermore is strongly recommended its inclusion on lists of endangered fauna and ensures the protection of their remaining habitats. © 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Ictiologia.},

Further, within both, relations are organized in such a way as to integrate two distinct principles of relatedness: "sangue" ("blood") and "consideração" ("intentional" relatedness).

The unexpected size of this waste fraction gave rise to work on the causes of waste and on its distribution over the product life cycle specific to fruit and vegetables. Waste was defined as being the combination of losses and scraps. Administrative shortcomings were identified as basic reasons for waste. At the producer and consumer ends of the cycle, negligence was shown to be the single most important problem. Fruit and vegetables deteriorate during the operations of handling, transport, packaging, storage, selling and consumption. The study detailed the occurrence of waste at all of these stages. In the medium-size Brazilian city, the total waste of fruit and vegetables was shown to amount to 16.6% weight in the marketing stage of the life cycle. At the consumer level, it was measured as 3.4% weight of all household garbage. Specific reasons for this waste were identified at the levels of producer, wholesaler and retailer. Short-term remedies were pointed out that invariably corrected deficient management procedures. It was shown that very simple administrative measures can significantly reduce the spoilage of fruit and vegetables. Long-term strategies involve the creation of sample cases for administration of the fruit and vegetables life cycle at all stages.},

The main objective is to help the implementation of capital enhancing policies towards the poor. The strategy followed is to analyze three different types of impacts that increasing the assets of the poor may have on social welfare. The first part of the paper evaluates the possession of different types of capital along the income distribution. This exercise can be perceived as an augmentation of income based poverty measures by incorporating the direct effect exerted by asset holdings on social welfare. The second part of the paper describes the income generating impact that asset holdings may have on poverty. It studies how the accumulation of different types of capital impact income-based poverty outcomes using logistic regressions. The third part studies die effect that increasing asset holdings of the poor has on improving poor individuals ability in dealing with adverse income shocks. This consist in studying the interaction between earnings dynamics, capital market imperfections and financial behavior taking into account different time horizons. Long-run issues are related to the study of low frequency income fluctuations and life-cycle assets holdings using cohort analysis. Short-run issues are related to assessing the poor behavior and welfare losses in dealing with high frequency gaps between income and desired consumption. The analysis earnings and poverty dinamics in conducted with panel data while qualitative data is used for the analysis of household short-run financial behavior.},

	abstract = {Stands of babassu palms (Orbignya martiana) occupy an area of Brazil estimated at nearly 200,000 km2, concentrated in the states of Maranhão, Piauí and Goiás. Babassu's cryptogeal germination, establishing the apical meristem of the plant below ground for its early growth and development, enables it to survive human disturbance, making the palm an integral part of shifting cultivation and pastoral farming systems. People obtain a multitude of products from babassu throughout the palm's life cycle: leaves are used widely for thatch, basketry, and construction; trunks for palmito and bridges; the fruit for feed, oil and, charcoal. As many as 450,000 subsistence-level households rely on the sale of babassu kernels, used in a regional vegetable oil industry, for an important share of their cash incomes. Deforestation pressures and technological innovation toward an industry based on mechanical processing of whole babassu fruit threaten to reduce benefits the palm provides to the region's rural poor. Understanding how babassu is used by rural families who depend upon it will help to make current efforts at "domesticating" the palm and whole-fruit processing more responsive to human needs. © 1985 The New York Botanical Garden.},

Muscidifurax uniraptor Kogan & Legner (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae) is one of the main parasitoids that occur in poultry farms at São Paulo State, Brazil. The objective of this study was to determine the life cycle duration, the thermal requirements and the parasitism of M. uniraptor on Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae) pupae under constant temperatures. The experiment was realized in climatized chambers at seven temperatures (18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30 and 32 ± 1°C), 70 ± 10% R.H. and 14 h of photophase. In each chamber 200 house fly pupae (24 to 48 h old) were exposed to 40 partenogenetic female parasitoids (0 to 24 h old) for 24 h. The temperature influenced the development and reproduction of M. uniraptor. The lowest value of the egg-adult period was 17 days, and occurred for 30°C and the parasitism and progeny emergence were highest at 28°C (87 and 63.5%, respectively). The lowest temperature threshold for the parasitoid females was 9.43°C, with a thermal constant of 366.62 degree-days. The temperature elevation reduces the duration of the egg to adult period (between 18 and 30°C) and increases the parasitism (between 18 and 28°C) of M. uniraptor. Temperatures between 28 and 30°C are the most adequated for rearing M. uniraptor on house fly pupae. © 2001, Scientia Agricola. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The definition of simple and reliable emission baselines is crucial to foster clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. This paper assesses a project methodology that could boost large-scale energy-efficiency projects in the sector of domestic appliances. The baseline appliance is defined a priori in a "conservative" manner as the design option minimizing life-cycle social costs. The project methodology consists in a program which rebates new appliances according to their emission savings compared to the baseline. Is the proposed baseline acceptable? What could be the impact of such project on emissions? To address these questions, we look for insights from a hypothetical case on Brazilian refrigerators. A rational choice model is developed which assumes that households select design options minimizing life-cycle private costs. Results suggest that electricity tariff distortions and financial constraints might hamper project performances and allow significant free-riding. Low income households remain trapped into low-efficiency choices and high income households adopt outperforming appliances, whether rebated or not. However, simple solutions likely to improve the project methodology do exist. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The comparison uses a demographic approach, based on the estimation of an age-cohort model. The model takes into account three combined aspects of time: the stage in the life cycle, the generation, and the period. Previous analyses conducted for developed countries indicated that the period effect (including the influence of income) could be considered as residual, in the face of stability of behavior of generations during the observed part of their life cycles. Models for the regions were estimated by using a series of transportation surveys (with the exception of Puebla). The results indicate that comparable patterns can be observed with respect to the life cycle and generation effects, although the ages and generations at which maximum motorization occurs vary among countries, according to their different histories of diffusion of the automobile. On the other hand, the spatial pattern of household motorization presents some fundamental differences for the urban areas of developed and developing countries. Paris and Montreal have higher motorization in the suburbs, but the results for São Paulo and Puebla show the opposite, suggesting the relevance of income effects because the populations in suburban areas have lower income levels.},

This fish assemblage represented 85% of the total catches of the experimental fishery surveyed between 1993 and 1997. To evaluate the maturation and spawning processes, qualitative (macroscopic stages of maturation) and quantitative (gonadosomatic index) attributes were considered which were combined in a reproductive activity index. Four types of occupation were found in the mangrove, according to the reproductive patterns presented by each species. It was estimated that the Guaratuba mangrove is used as a spawning site either regularly or occasionally by about 40% of the species, that make up 41% to 46% of the total abundance of this fish assemblage. However, besides the spawning species, the mangrove attracts other species at advanced stages of maturation. The use of mangrove habitat for reproductive activity by the species is 52 to 57% of the total fish abundance. Spring and summer are the seasons most associated with the maturation and spawning processes. Although most of the assemblage is formed by species that do not permanently inhabit the system, the Guaratuba mangrove is a significant site for the life cycle of estuarine and marine species occupying this coastal region.

	abstract = {It is demonstrated that dispersed biomass residues (bagasse, sawdust) can be processed into hard carbonaceous blocks, panels or boards with good strength and thermodynamic properties. There are two possible approaches: to mould dispersed biomass charcoal with a phenol-formaldehyde binder or to produce this material by carbonising the biomass fiberboard prepared by making use of steam explosion autohydrolysis pulp or steam explosion lignin as a binder. In the first step, steam explosion lignin, as a modifier and a binder is introduced to the lignocellulosic biomass by impregnation or during the hot pressing process to form a hard fiberboard. By subsequent carbonisation of the fiberboard panels or blocks, carbonised panels or blocks with high bending and crushing strength and suitable thermodynamic properties are obtained due to the formation of an internal lignin reinforcement in cell lumina and impregnation of cell walls with lignin solution or molten lignin. The carbonised panels demonstrate a good dimensional stability after a standard treatment with water. The bending strength of the carbonised panels after 24 h soaking in water is 93% of that in dry state. The thermodynamic properties and porosity of the carbonised panels demonstrate their suitability for use as a building material. Lignin, a natural binder of fiberboards, has proven to be suitable for preparation of cabonaceous panels and boards. In this respect new carbon building blocks and panels from moulded biomass and carbonised steam exploded biomass act as a concentrated form of long term carbon storage and will be a factor stabilizing the growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere.

The number of cells per nest ranged from 3 to 62. Cells containing prey (larvae of Lepidoptera) numbered from 4 to 29. B. dyscherus is a univoltine species. Adults emerge from September to December, and nesting takes place at the beginning of the following year; however, the developmental period for some immatures with prolonged diapause lasted up to 596 days. The total duration of immature stages in nests collected in 1996 was less for males than for females. The sex ratio for the total population was 1.5 males: 1 female with males emerging earlier than females. A life table was constructed, and details of the life cycle of the wasps and parasitoids are presented. The most common mortality factors were either endogenous or due to Melittobia sp. (Eulophidae).},

	abstract = {The life cycle of basic food items was studied in order to discover the reasons for low landfill diversion rates of this material. Management failures at key points of the cycle were identified. Subjects of study were commercialization procedures of fruit and vegetables before consumption, consumption proper and after-consumption disposal procedures for food scraps in the Brazilian context. Before consumption, the rate of lost fruit and vegetables stood at 16 wt.% of the total quantity commercialized. During consumption by residents, the waste rate of food amounted to 9 wt.% of all collected household garbage. In the after-consumption sector of the cycle, biodegradables represented 72 wt.% of all household garbage collected by official means in a typical Brazilian town. The numbers produced clearly identified landfill diversion of biodegradables as a management problem. The authors experimented with original proactive administrative procedures designed to set landfill diversion targets. The occurrence of wasted fruit and vegetables at the wholesaler and retailer levels was identified. Remedies were proposed and tested to reduce this waste by at least 50%. In the after-consumption sector, the notion of divided garbage collection was developed and applied to test communities. It was shown that biodegradables may be collected separately from the rest of household waste. This resulted in a diversion potential of 100% for biodegradables alone and 77 wt.% for all collected household waste. The study produced a formal policy proposal to municipal administrations to avoid the need for tipping of biodegradable material. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper highlights the importance and demonstrates the application of a segmentation strategy, based on the concept of the family life cycle, in real estate market analysis. Each stage in the family life cycle has its particular preferences regarding locational attributes. Neighbourhood characteristics can, therefore, reveal which segments should be the target of marketing campaigns. In order to increase the chances of a building successfully meeting the user's requirements and therefore of achieving quick sales, its spatial conception, facilities and leisure attributes must be orientated to satisfy these different segments. To confirm this hypothesis and to exemplify the method presented, two high rise apartment buildings, in the city of Florianópolis, Brazil, are evaluated. The compatibility of their architectural attributes and the identified needs of respective potential marketing segments (according to the study of the locations) is verified. The results of this analysis, based on how fast the apartments were sold, confirm the effectiveness of the method. © 2002, MCB UP Limited},
