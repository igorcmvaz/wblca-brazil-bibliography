Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to examine the economic and social factors that
   influence individual savings in Brazil based on the life cycle
   hypothesis (LCH). Design/methodology/approach The authors use data
   sourced from 2017 to 2018 Household Budget Surveys to analyse the
   individual savings of Brazilian aged from 18 to 80. Findings Using a
   conventional logistic regression model, results of this study suggest
   that several demographic characteristics, such as education, economic
   and social factors, influence individual savings in Brazil. For
   instance, this paper finds a non-linear relationship between age and
   individual savings, following LCH concepts. Originality value These data
   provide us with a unique opportunity to investigate the determinants of
   individual savings in Brazil. In examining this question, this study
   contributes to the literature by providing new evidence to help the
   current political debate about the Brazilian social security system.
   Against this background, social policies should be designed to promote
   savings, especially in groups with a lower likelihood of savings.},

Volume = {169},
Pages = {748-761},
Month = {APR 30},
Abstract = {This paper aims to quantify the environmental performance of four
   typical Brazilian residential buildings with different typologies,
   through the complete Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) from ``cradle to
   grave{''}. The LCA considers eight impact categories, including carbon
   emissions and energy demand. Our analysis includes the relative
   importance of life cycle phases, construction processes and materials
   that make the largest contributions to the buildings' environmental
   impacts. According to the results, the operational phase is the most
   critical, the foundation, structure, masonry and coating have the
   greatest environmental impacts and in terms of materials, concrete,
   ceramic tiles and steel made the largest contributions. (C) 2018

Title = {Life cycle integrated analysis of thermal, environmental and cost
   performance of building envelope system: Small house case study
   considering grid mix change in Brazil},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {310},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Dwellings with inadequate envelopes tend to present higher energy
   consumption, consequently, higher energy costs and significant
   environmental impacts. However, improving performance may increase
   initial costs. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) are
   used to independently evaluate the environmental and cost implications
   of thermal performance. Thus, it is necessary to help designers
   synthesize these criteria. This article analyzes the thermal,
   environmental, and cost performance of a single-family house in Brazil's
   coldest climate zone with alternative conventional and innovative
   construction systems. The method has three steps: research problem
   identification and case study definition; criteria assessment (energy
   simulation, LCA, and LCC); results analysis. Investments in the building
   envelope can reduce 20\% of energy consumption per year, 12\% of Global
   Warming Potential emissions, and 17\% of Cumulative Energy Demand. The
   assessment included two different scenarios of the electricity grid mix.
   The scenario with cleaner energy had a 25\% reduction in the
   environmental impact. Thus, future potential changes in the electricity
   grid mix must be considered in building assessment because of the
   typically long building life cycle. The envelope adaptations improve
   environmental and thermal performance and influence the entire life
   cycle costs due to energy consumption. Thus, the results help in
   decision-making.},

Title = {Study of Alternatives for the Design of Sustainable Low-Income Housing

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Despite insufficient housing facilities, particularly in developing
   countries, construction systems are generally selected intuitively or
   based on conventional solutions sanctioned by practice. The present
   study aims to evaluate different options for the design of low-income
   housing in Brazil by integrating the life cycle assessment (LCA) into
   the decision-making process. To achieve this objective, three
   single-family projects with different construction systems were selected
   and analyzed. The most sustainable design was selected through the
   analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The considered parameters, which were
   obtained through a survey with professionals and customers, included
   cost, environmental impact, thermal comfort, construction time, and
   cultural acceptance. LCA and life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) were
   performed with the frontier's system considering the cradle-to-gate
   cycle, which included the extraction of raw materials, manufacture of
   building materials, and housing construction. The projects were modelled
   using Autodesk Revit software with the Tally application for LCA
   evaluation. The results indicated that light steel frame houses present
   a better behavior than other conventional alternatives, and the
   integration of building information modelling with LCA and LCCA in the
   design phase can lead to the development of more sustainable houses.},

Abstract = {In an integrated project, the main decisions are evaluated by the
   project team in the conceptual phase. With the large volume of
   information needed to carry out a project in the civil construction
   industry, the demand for more rational and better performing processes
   is growing. As a strategic role, the BIM model combined with the Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA) help in the selection of materials and
   construction techniques for more sustainable projects. The analyzes
   generated make it possible for companies and architectural design
   offices to decide which strategies to adopt to reduce environmental
   impacts. There is a wide variety of software available on the market to
   assist in these studies. This article presents an overview of Brazilian
   scientific productions, within the range of 2010 to 2017, that use
   environmental analysis linked to BIM. It analyzes the evolutionary
   profile of the scientific production of simulations and the exchange
   between the exchange of information to arrive at environmental analyses.
   It was possible to conclude that BIM+LCA simulations and information
   exchange between applications and users require detailed planning and
   fundamental modifications in the design process. Another point noted is
   that, in Brazil, there is no information generated by national databases
   for a complete LCA, which is fundamental in decision-making during the
   life cycle of the building.},

Title = {Actual sources of life cycle impacts: Elementary processes and flows
   causing environmental impacts for a typical Brazilian building},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {249},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a valuable tool to enhance the
   environmental performance of buildings. However, the increasing number
   of impact categories required by construction LCA standards makes it
   difficult to collect primary data and understand LCA results.
   Furthermore, most LCA studies only analyse aggregated impact results,
   failing to identify the specific processes that should be optimized to
   mitigate environmental impacts. This work shows the additional insights
   that can be gained from analysing disaggregated LCA results. We identify
   the specific elementary processes and flows causing each environmental
   impact for a typical Brazilian building used as a case study. This
   cradle-to-grave LCA study covers the 16 impact categories required by EN
   15804. The findings reveal that the environmental impacts of buildings
   are primarily caused by a few elementary processes and flows. Multiple
   impact categories share common sources, implying that at least half of
   the indicators convey redundant information for decision-making as they
   point to the same actions for mitigating those impacts. Additionally,
   some impacts are caused by background elementary processes beyond the
   influence of construction stakeholders. Interpreting LCA results at the
   elementary process level allows us to reflect on the suitability of LCA
   to support decisions. It suggests potential strategies to streamline the
   LCA scope currently specified in construction LCA standards by excluding
   redundant indicators or impacts determined by uncontrollable background
   processes. Streamlining LCA can expedite the adoption of the life cycle
   approach in the construction sector and improve its contribution to
   informed decision-making.},

Title = {Life Cycle Assessment and Exergoenvironmental Analysis of a
   Double-Effect Vapor Absorption Chiller Using Green Hydrogen, Natural
   Gas, and Biomethane},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {This study conducts a life cycle assessment and exergoenvironmental
   evaluation of a double-effect vapor absorption chiller (DEAC) with a
   cooling capacity of 352 kW, employing three different energy sources:
   natural gas, biomethane, and green hydrogen. The main objectives of this
   paper are as follows: (i) provide an exergoenvironmental model for DEAC
   technologies, (ii) evaluation of a case-study where a DEAC is used to
   cover the cooling demand of a specific university building in the
   Northeast of Brazil, and (iii) evaluate the scenario where the DEAC is
   fed by green hydrogen (GH2) and compare it with conventional energy
   resources (natural gas and biomethane). In order to develop the
   exergoenvironmental model, two methodologies are essential: a
   thermodynamic analysis and a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The
   thermodynamic analysis was carried out using the Engineering Equation
   Solver (EES: 10.998) software. The LCA has been developed through the
   open-source software openLCA version 1.10.3, with the Ecoinvent 3.7.1
   life cycle inventory database, whereas the chosen life cycle inventory
   assessment (LCIA) method was the ReCiPe Endpoint LCA method
   (Humanitarian, medium weighting-H, A). The main results indicate that
   green hydrogen provides a 99.84\% reduction in environmental impacts
   compared to natural gas during the operational phase, while biomethane
   reduces these impacts by 54.21\% relative to natural gas. In the context
   of life cycle assessment (LCA), green hydrogen decreases fossil resource
   depletion by 18\% and climate change-related emissions by 33.16\%
   compared to natural gas. This study contributes to enhancing the
   understanding of the environmental and exergoenvironmental impacts of a
   double-effect vapor absorption chiller by varying the fuel usage during
   the operational phase.},

Title = {Regionalized inventory data in LCA of public housing: A comparison
   between two conventional typologies in southern Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {238},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) can provide the environmental impact of
   buildings from its initial construction until its demolition. Of
   particular interest are the environmental impacts of public housing as
   developing economies are facing the growing need for housing. However,
   the validity of the LCA results is directly related to how
   representative is the inventory data to regional characteristics.
   Existing LCA of buildings in Brazil frequently ignores regional data
   when compiling the LCA and there is a lack of study on this topic. This
   study performs an LCA that compares two types of public housing in
   southern Brazil: single-family dwellings (house condominium) and
   multi-family dwellings (apartment condominium). The unit areas compared
   are of similar size, and the construction methods and materials used are
   also similar. The LCA was performed using regionalized and
   non-regionalized inventory data based on ISO 14040/44 and EN 15804
   (modules A to C). Data from the Ecoinvent database v.3.3 was used with
   adaptations that reflected regional characteristics of Brazilian
   construction practices. Results show that the use stage (module B) is
   the most relevant in all environmental impact categories considered,
   particularly relevant are the electricity consumed (module B6) and
   replacement of constructions materials (module B4). Despite similar
   overall impacts, the single-family dwelling exhibited higher impact
   numbers compared to the multi-family dwelling, largely due to design and
   construction characteristics (module A). Regionalized data strongly
   influenced the results when compared to non-regionalized background
   data; therefore, the results obtained using non-regionalized data may
   lead to inconsistent decision-making. This study is one of the first LCA
   of buildings in Brazil using inventory data regionalized to local
   conditions and demonstrates the importance of regionalization since
   environmental impacts can vary significantly. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Uncertainties related to the replacement stage in LCA of buildings: A
   case study of a structural masonry clay hollow brick wall},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {251},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The construction of even simple buildings, such as housing, consumes
   great amounts of nonrenewable resources throughout their service life.
   Generally, a building has a long life-cycle, determining the impact
   generated due to the production of materials and building use is only
   part of the problem. To predict the building elements that must be
   replaced over the life span of a building into a model is complicated
   and this step often receives less attention than expected. As a part of
   its use stage in a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), the research reported
   herein aims to quantify the uncertainties related to incorporating a
   building's replacement and repair needs into a model and defines
   different substitution scenarios based on international data. Inventory
   data uncertainty was also analyzed by comparing Global life cycle
   inventory with Brazilian regionalized data. One square meter of
   structural clay hollow brick wall was studied, with a scope encompassing
   a cradle-to-grave scenario, assuming a 50-year life span. Results
   obtained indicate the life cycle inventory choice affects the results
   significantly. How the service life is modeled may cause high variations
   the LCAs results. The use stage impact ranges from between 6\% and 72\%,
   depending on the assessed scenario, life cycle inventory, and impact
   category. Scenarios that applied the design life criteria generated
   greater impact than those based on documented service life data.
   Definitions about the service life used to model building elements
   replacement are essential to reduce uncertainties and will set the stage
   to refine these models, thereby improving their accuracy. (C) 2019

Title = {ASSESSING THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF BUILDINGS IN BRAZIL: A CASE
   STUDY OF A HOUSING COMPLEX},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Buildings play a central role in the low-carbon future and pose
   challenges for integration with sustainable development, especially in
   Brazil, where urban areas are still expanding and the implementation of
   environmental tools, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), faces more
   difficulties. The aim of this paper is to assess the greenhouse gases
   (GHG) emissions during the whole life cycle of a housing complex located
   in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For this purpose, a life cycle-based analysis
   was carried out to estimate the GHG emission from the production of the
   most commonly used building materials, such as steel, cement, ceramic,
   wood, among others; transport activities; and the construction, use
   (energy consumption during 50-year useful life), maintenance and
   demolition of the housing complex. According to the results, the GHG
   emissions generated during the housing complex's life cycle are 282.62
   tCO(2)eq, which can be expressed as 1,009.34 kg CO(2)eq./m(2)/50-year or
   20.19 kg CO(2)eq./m(2)/year. These emissions are dominated by the use
   stage (56\%), which is followed by the pre-use (30\%) and end-of-life
   (14\%) stages. Indirect emissions accounted for more than half of GHG
   emissions (57\%), mainly driven by emissions from building materials
   (85.47 t CO(2)eq.; or 30\%). Cement was responsible for 22\% of embodied
   GHG emissions from building materials. These findings are relevant to
   the Brazilian context in which environmental issues have not determined
   the choice of building materials. Furthermore, this paper supports the
   improvement of the LCA usefulness in Brazil as it contributes to the
   mitigation of the lack of national datasets.},

Abstract = {Recognizing that paper and cardboard are the most common materials in
   Solid Household Waste (SHW) management, the objective of the study
   presented herein was to apply the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   methodology to the procedures associated with the selective collection
   of paper and cardboard in a nucleus in Joao Pessoa, Paraiba. LCA
   quantifies the environmental loads throughout the life cycle of an
   activity and is standardized by the International Organization for
   Standardization (ISO) and the Brazilian Association of Technical
   Standards (Associacao Brasileira de Normas Tecnicas - ABNT). LCA
   considered all the phases of SHW management: regular collection,
   selective collection, recycling, final disposal and intermediate
   transportation. The SimaPro software was used, with the Ecoinvent
   database and CML-IA baseline environmental assessment method, version
   3.00/World 2000. In 2004, it was verified that selective collection
   included 11\% of the SHW generated in the districts served by the
   sorting unit. The remainder (89\%) was, in its majority, transported and
   destined for the Metropolitan Sanitary Landfill of Joao Pessoa.
   Interpretation of the LCA results for the different impact categories
   revealed that recycling brings positive environmental benefits when the
   atmospheric emissions associated with eutrophication, global warming and
   photochemical oxidation were considered. An overall negative value was
   obtained for these categories, due to recycling, in comparison with the
   other analyzed phases (selective collection, regular collection,
   consumption of energy in the sheds, sorting unit, transportation and
   landfilling). For atmospheric emissions associated with depletion of the
   ozone layer and acidification, negative emissions associated with
   recycling were not sufficient to produce an overall negative balance.},

Abstract = {Uncertainties evaluation is increasingly gaining traction within life
   cycle assessment (LCA), due to its key role as environmental decision
   support tool. When applied at wholebuilding scale, the large variety of
   materials, subjective choices and long lifespans introduce parameter,
   scenario and model uncertainties throughout the life cycle. Since
   normative choices are unavoidable within whole-building LCA (wbLCA), in
   this article we carried out a so-called `scenario' uncertainty
   assessment for one illustrative case study. First, three uncertainty
   sources were selected, to include the two drivers most frequently cited
   in literature (reference service life and end of life management
   alternatives) and material wastage, a relevant issue to factor in
   variable construction optimization levels in contexts like Brazil.
   Cumulative energy demand (CED) and CML 2001 v.2.05 methods were used for
   calculating deterministic values of non-renewable embodied energy and
   global warming potential in SimaPro 7.3 The uncertainty assessment
   combined scenario analysis, stochastic modelling (Monte Carlo simulation
   of triangular probability distributions for the uncertainty drivers
   investigated) and global sensitivity analysis (GSA). The GSA confirmed
   the dominant contribution of the operational phase strongly influenced
   by components replacement rate - to of life cycle non-renewable embodied
   energy and global warming potential result variance, whilst construction
   and end of life stages showed no correlation with life cycle results.
   Findings from this research also highlight the strategic importance of
   gathering service life information adherent to the assessed context.
   Building components replacement rates induced by the Brazilian standard
   are overestimated relatively to international figures used in LCAs
   worldwide.},

Abstract = {The Life Cycle Assessment enables us to determine environmental loads
   associated to products, processes or activities. This paper uses this
   methodology to evaluate the impact of inner walls, considering as case
   study a traditional house in Brazil, made by: ceramic bricks masonry and
   sand and cement mortar. The impacts are assessed with the CML2001 method
   for a lifespan of the building of 50 years. Results show which phase has
   the greatest influence over life cycle impacts, the most impactful
   material-component, the waste behavior and other peculiarities of life
   cycle impacts derived from masonry walls. In addition, we created a
   method for estimating the demand for materials, waste generation and
   distance traveled in the transportation of materials and waste. This
   method can assist not only, in environmental assessment, but also in
   construction and waste management, and policy development. (C) 2014

Title = {Evaluation of Water Heating Systems Through Life Cycle Assessment},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Pages = {131-142},
Abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate water-heating systems through Life
   Cycle Assessment (LCA). The method involves the application of LCA for
   the analysis of the global warming potential of water-heating systems
   that use electricity, gas or solar energy as input. The analysis was
   performed for a single-family house and also for a four-storey
   residential building located in three cities in Brazil. The SimaPro
   computer programme, widely used in the global market when it comes to
   LCA, was used. The results showed that for the single-family house, the
   electric shower head is the option that causes less environmental impact
   for all cities, followed by the solar heater with electric backup and,
   finally, gas heater with continuous flow. As for the four-storey
   residential building, the solar heater was the best alternative,
   followed by the electric shower head, electric boiler, gas heater with
   continuous flow and, finally, gas boiler. The use phase was responsible
   for most of the total impact on most systems except for solar heater.
   The main conclusion is that, in Brazil, water-heating systems that use
   electricity and solar energy should be preferred over those that use
   natural gas.},

Title = {Case Study: LCA Methodology Applied to Materials Management in a
   Brazilian Residential Construction Site},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2016},
Abstract = {The construction industry is increasingly concerned with improving the
   social, economic, and environmental indicators of sustainability. More
   than ever, the growing demand for construction materials reflects
   increased consumption of raw materials and energy, particularly during
   the phases of extraction, processing, and transportation of materials.
   This work aims to help decision-makers and to promote life cycle
   thinking in the construction industry. For this purpose, the life cycle
   assessment (LCA) methodology was chosen to analyze the environmental
   impacts of building materials used in the construction of a residence
   project in Sao Goncalo, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The LCA methodology,
   based on ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 guidelines, is applied with available
   databases and the SimaPro program. As a result, this work shows that
   there is a substantial waste of nonrenewable energy, increasing global
   warming and harm to human health in this type of construction. This
   study also points out that, for this type of Brazilian construction,
   ceramic materials account for a high percentage of the mass of a total
   building and are thus responsible for the majority of environmental
   impacts.},

Pages = {70-78},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The main objective of this paper is to propose a method for quantifying
   the energy consumption in the life cycle of different plumbing fixtures.
   The method can be used to estimate the energy consumption in the
   production, use and disposal phases of plumbing fixtures. This allows
   for the comparison between the performances of different plumbing
   fixtures and the identification of the share of each phase on the energy
   consumption over the life cycle. The method was applied in a case study
   in Southern Brazil to quantify the energy consumption in the life cycle
   of two types of taps installed on a university campus. The total energy
   consumption in the life cycle of ordinary and self-closing taps used in
   the study was respectively, 177.71 MJ and 164.11 MJ over 4 years.
   Production accounted for 33\% of the energy consumption share of the
   ordinary tap, while the use phase accounted for 65\% and the disposal
   phase for 2\%. For the self-closing tap, the production phase accounted
   for 46\% of the energy consumption share, the use phase for 52\% and the
   disposal phase for 2\%. Therefore, considering the energy consumption in
   the life cycle, self-closing taps should be preferred over ordinary
   taps.},

Title = {Primary data priorities for the life cycle inventory of construction

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {6},
Pages = {980-997},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose Life cycle assessment can support decisions for improving the
   environmental performance of construction products. However, the amount
   of data required for developing life cycle inventories limits the
   adoption of LCA. This work associates the interpretation of the impact
   results of construction products at the unit process level with a
   quantitative definition for the foreground and background system, for
   guiding primary data collection towards foreground processes that can be
   affected by decision-makers in the construction sector. Methods A set of
   construction products commonly used in Brazil is selected, and their
   cradle-to-gate life cycle inventories are modeled using the ecoinvent
   database (version 2). Life cycle impact assessment is performed using
   the ReCiPe Midpoint Hierarchist method. The contribution of each process
   during the life cycle of construction products for each impact category
   is quantified. These processes are associated with economic sectors,
   which are classified as belonging to the foreground or background system
   from the perspective of the construction industry. Foreground sectors
   are those controlled or influenced by the construction sector and are
   defined based on the production share consumed by the construction value
   chain. The elementary flows defining each impact category are also
   identified. Results and discussion Foreground processes show significant
   contributions to most impact results of construction products. Global
   warming, fine particulate matter formation, ozone formation,
   acidification, human carcinogenic toxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity
   are mainly caused by direct emissions and fossil fuel combustion in
   manufacturing processes. Land occupation for production activities
   contributes to land use change, while the consumption of fuels, raw
   materials, and water causes fossil and mineral resource scarcity and
   water consumption respectively. Freshwater and marine ecotoxicities and
   human non-carcinogenic toxicity have foreground contributions only for
   steel and copper products due to emissions from the landfilling of
   mining tails. Ionizing radiation and stratospheric ozone depletion are
   mostly driven by background processes. A reduced group of elementary
   flows covers a big share of the environmental impacts of most
   construction products. Conclusions The results indicate priorities for
   life cycle inventory primary data collection of construction products,
   by focusing on foreground processes and the corresponding elementary
   flows that cause many of the potential embodied impacts of construction.
   Increasing the availability of primary data for these processes improves
   the reliability of LCA-based decisions in the construction sector,
   especially in countries which still lack local LCI databases.},

   RESIDENTIAL HOUSING: A CASE STUDY},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Number = {3},
Pages = {41-60},
Abstract = {The design process influences the resulting environmental impacts and
   life cycle costs. Life cycle assessment can assist the construction
   industry in selecting more sustainable technological alternatives. In
   this context, wall systems play a signifi-cant role in the environmental
   and economic performance of a building. This paper compares the
   potential energy, costs, and environmental impacts of three structural
   wall construction systems (ceramic, concrete, and soil-cement blocks)
   for standard residential housing in Southern Brazil, considering a
   50-year lifespan. The highest environmental impacts are related to the
   use stage of all three systems. The ceramic brick system presents the
   highest impact in the product stage, the concrete block system in the
   use stage, and the soil cement brick system in the construction stage.
   The concrete block system presents the highest relative net present
   value, followed by soil cement and ceramic brick systems. The impacts
   for the soil-cement block system are similar to those for ceramic block,
   while the concrete block system is the most expensive, energy demanding,
   and CO2 releasing. The results demonstrate the importance of producing
   criteria for architectural decision-making based on scientific evidence
   when choosing wall systems.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of the environmental influence of wooden and
   concrete utility poles based on service lifetime},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {12},
Pages = {2030-2041},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Purpose Many applications of life cycle assessment do not consider the
   variability of the service lifetime of different structures, and this
   may be a relevant factor in an environmental impact assessment. This
   paper aims to determine the influence of the service lifetime on the
   potential environmental impacts of wooden and concrete poles in the
   electricity distribution system.
   Methods The estimation of service lifetime was conducted using the
   factorial method. The life cycle assessment was applied using SimaPro
   software and considered the entire life cycle of utility poles, from the
   extraction of raw materials to the final disposal. Then, an evaluation
   of the environmental impacts using the CML IA baseline method was
   performed. The study included the analysis of uncertainty using the
   Monte Carlo method.
   Results and discussion In general, the wooden poles had a lower
   potential environmental impact compared to the concrete poles. The
   result of the sensitivity analysis considering the variability of the
   chromated copper arsenate wood preservative retention rate suggests that
   the frequency of maintenance affects the service lifetime. Often, the
   comparison of products in the LCA perspective is carried out by
   considering similar useful lifetime services for the different
   alternatives, and this study shows that the environmental performance of
   products or services is directly proportional to the lifetime. It is a
   crucial parameter that has to be clarified in order to reduce
   uncertainty in the results.
   Conclusions Thus, some factors such as material quality, design
   adjustments and routine maintenance extend the service lifetime of a
   product or process and are shown to be effective ways to reduce
   environmental impacts. Therefore, the service lifetime has a significant
   influence on the development of the life cycle assessment. Comparative
   LCA studies are often sensitive to parameters that may even change the
   ranking of selected impact categories. All in all, from the sensitivity
   analysis highlighted in this study, the variability of lifetime service
   has proven to be one of the most prominent factors influencing
   comparative LCA results.},

Abstract = {Introducing energy efficiency techniques in schools can significantly
   reduce energy consumption, as Brazil has a large public education
   system. The main objective of this work was to select the set of
   construction components with the lowest environmental impact for use in
   schools in Florian \& oacute;polis, southern Brazil, through life cycle
   assessment (LCA). Two types of walls, four types of roofs, and two types
   of window frames were studied. Ceramic bricks measuring 14x9x19cm and
   9x19x19cm were considered for the walls. Wood and aluminium were used
   for the window frames, with single glass panes on all windows. For the
   roofs, fibre cement tiles with a PVC ceiling, a drywall ceiling, and a
   concrete slab were considered, as well as ceramic tiles with a PVC
   ceiling. Computer simulations were conducted using the EnergyPlus
   program in order to determine the building's energy consumption. SimaPro
   was used to run the LCA. The construction of the building and one year
   of its energy consumption were analysed to select the combination of
   components with the lowest impact on the building's life cycle. Finally,
   the set consisting of 9x19x19cm ceramic brick walls, wooden frames, and
   roof with fibre cement tiles and PVC ceiling presented the lowest
   environmental impact.},

Title = {Comparison of the environmental performance of ceramic brick and
   concrete blocks in the vertical seals' subsystem in residential
   buildings using life cycle assessment},
Journal = {CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {5},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This work presents an evaluation and comparison of the environmental
   impacts generated in the vertical sealing subsystem of a single-family
   residential unit, using the methodology of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   to evaluate the environmental impacts of ceramic blocks and concrete
   blocks applied in the same unit. The research is justified by the
   possibility of using LCA method to increase the sustainability of the
   construction process. The novelty herein is to identify the critical
   points (i.e. the respiratory effects, the intensive use of fossil fuels,
   and the consequent climate changes) in the LCA of the building materials
   of two types of masonry commonly used in Brazil, namely ceramic blocks
   and concrete blocks. The method adopted is following the recommendations
   of ISO 14040 and ISO 14044, including the four main phases. It was also
   integrated the EcoInvent as an endpoint method and Eco-indicator 99.
   Ecoinvent is of foreign origin, it does not accurately portray the
   Brazilian reality, however, it was used because there are still no data
   at the national level. The Analysis of the environmental impact of
   particular systems may help select building materials, about the
   environmental performance at an early designing phase of buildings.
   Categories were established based on the endpoint categories that are
   ecosystem quality (EQ), human health (HH), and natural resources (R).
   This work insight that the ceramic blocks appear to have the highest
   impacts concerning the R, with 46\%, while for the same impact the
   production of the concrete block represents 69\%. There is still a
   higher environmental impact in the case of masonry in concrete blocks,
   mainly due to the brick burning stage in the cement manufacturing
   process. The masonry in ceramic bricks has its highest impact due to the
   step of burning the bricks. It is noted that both construction methods
   have the same critical points, however, the analysis of the
   environmental impact of particular systems may help select building
   materials, concerning the environmental performance in the early project
   phase. As a scientific contribution this study shows that LCA
   methodology can be a very useful and appropriate tool in sustainability
   studies in the construction industry. It is recognized that despite the
   inherent limitations of conducting an LCA based on a case study, the
   results will serve as a benchmark for Brazil brick production.},

Abstract = {Today, sustainability is an important and crucial issue regarding
   several activities performed by man. The professionals in the field of
   architecture and urbanism are increasingly being spurred to minimize
   environmental impacts and building costs. In developing cities, such as
   those from Northeast Brazil, the environment impact tends to be larger;
   therefore, the use of sustainable architecture becomes much more
   relevant. In this scenario, numerous sustainability practices are
   researched and developed to be applied to architectural projects, such
   as the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique, which might be used into
   architecture housing projects. Therefore, this research aims at
   establishing guidelines for sustainable building practices and low
   technology architecture in Northeast Brazil, mainly focusing on the
   state of Paraiba, based on parameters such as materials; energy, waste
   and environmental comfort. Because of this, four examples of
   internationally environmentally certified multi-family dwellings which
   carry LCA process in their construction have been chosen to be a case
   study, to associate them with the local reality outlined in problems of
   possible forms of implementation of feasible alternatives of
   sustainability in construction. It was found that there are viable
   practices for sustainable architecture in accordance with the local
   reality of the life cycle assessment process amongst the previously
   established parameters. The results provide evidence that it is
   achievable to apply the concepts of sustainability and efficiency in
   local architecture without using big technology, construction techniques
   or high costs.},

Abstract = {Purpose Aiming to simplify the extraction of embodied carbon data using
   a building information modeling (BIM) software, the purpose of this
   paper is to present a framework that integrates BIM and life cycle
   assessment (LCA), which are useful to the architecture, engineer and
   construction (AEC) industry. As a further purpose, this study also tests
   four different wall systems.
   Design/methodology/approach The study applies design science research
   and it presents a framework that integrates BIM and LCA. For analysis
   and validation, a case study features four different wall systems costs
   based on the Brazilian context. In the proposed framework, SimaPro8
   accomplishes the LCA, while ArchiCAD 19 the modeling.
   Findings The first analysis covers embodied carbon and the second covers
   the total cost of each m(2) of wall. The proposed framework performs
   well, and it is effective in the Brazilian context. Concerning the
   walls, the wood frame system is the most sustainable option within this
   analysis and the most financially feasible option in Brazil.
   Originality/value The present study contributes to embodied carbon data
   analysis, ensuring that the best choice of elements and components is
   being used in the building project. This BIM-LCA integrated solution is
   valuable not only to the AEC industry and to professionals, but also to
   future researchers. This analysis is of great value to new ventures,
   since the society shows a great concern about reducing GHGs emissions.},

Abstract = {The Life Cycle Assessment methodology is the most appropriate technique
   for evaluating municipal solid waste management systems. In recent
   times, its implementation has been spreading in different Latin American
   countries. So, this paper presents five applications of the Life Cycle
   Assessment methodology with the aim of evaluating the environmental
   performance of: a selective collection system for household waste in
   Spain; a waste electrical and electronic equipment management system,
   mainly focused on mobile phone devices, in Mexico; a construction and
   demolition waste management system in Argentina; the incorporation of
   selective collection in a municipal solid waste management system in
   Brazil; and finally, a municipal solid waste management system for
   household in Colombia. For each case study it has been made an
   inventory, identifying as a main handicap, the lack of inventory data in
   commercial databases adapted to different countries, different factions
   and different treatments of waste management. To solve this problem,
   inventory modeling has been performed as a combination of primary and
   secondary data. Finally, the contribution to different impact categories
   of stage of each life cycle waste management system has been obtained.
   Results provide a starting point for the selection and implementation of
   measures to promote the environmental improvement of waste management
   systems.},

Title = {Long-Term Experience of Teaching Life Cycle Assessment and Circular
   Design to Future Architects: A Learning by Doing Approach in a Design
   Studio Setting},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},

Abstract = {Architects and urbanists help to shape the built environment, which is
   both highly impactful and indispensable to support the sustainable
   development of any society. Hence, they must not only have a basic
   understanding but also be trained to routinely incorporate
   sustainability checks into their design practice. Published pedagogical
   experience with teaching life cycle assessment (LCA) in higher education
   usually covers students with engineering backgrounds, often at the
   graduate level. No records of regular courses for architecture and
   urbanism undergraduates were found. After eight years of teaching, and
   involving 213 students, this paper shares experience and insights gained
   in the only undergraduate architecture and urbanism course in Brazil
   openly dedicated to teaching LCA and circular design metrics within the
   design studio atmosphere. To encourage and inspire other initiatives,
   the article emphasizes the last four course offers. The current course
   design is aligned with recent recommendations and international
   practice. Still, the total workload is insufficient to adequately tackle
   complex design objects. Students' final grades across different years
   show improvements, but actual knowledge retention evaluation requires
   some post-course follow-up. We confirmed that undergraduate students can
   successfully apply LCA during design development with compatible
   additional effort if equipped with adequate tools. An online calculator
   was developed and is expected to allow expanded design experimentations
   in future editions.},

Title = {Building materials in a circular economy: The case of wood waste as
   CO2-sink in bio concrete},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {166},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {This paper aims to assess greenhouse gases' (GHG) emissions in the life
   cycle of wood bio-concretes (WBC) production when recycled wood shavings
   (WS) are used as a circular economy (CE) strategy. Two WBC were
   evaluated, one with a higher content of WS (WBC-HC) and another with a
   lower content (WBC-LC). Different WS recycling and transportation
   scenarios were evaluated. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology
   was used, considering a cradle-to-gate scope, comparing two methods for
   calculation of GHG emissions: IPCC GWP100 and GWP(bi)(o). The transport
   analysis was carried out considering the WBC production in 26 Brazilian
   cities, according to different locations where waste WS are generated.
   In order to increase the robustness of the study, a sensitivity analysis
   was performed for: types of WS allocation, the origin of WS (waste x
   virgin materials), transportation efficiency, and electricity grid
   matrix. We verified that the waste WS content increase in WBC resulted
   in climate change mitigation for all cases and scenarios (when the
   biogenic carbon is considered). However, this benefit can vary according
   to WS availability and transport efficiency. Therefore, transportation
   must deserve special attention for the CE evaluation. When the
   GWP(bi)(o) method is used and CO2 capture during the eucalypt growth is
   accounted for, the GHG emissions of WBC production can be very low (15
   kgCO(2)-eq/m(3)). We conclude that recycling wood waste to use in WBC
   can be considered a good CO2 sink and a pathway for the low-carbon and
   circular construction industry.},

   Case Study},
Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {This study aims to assess the environmental impacts of different
   construction systems employed in a single-story low-income housing
   development utilizing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The LCA was applied
   to the roof, wall, coating, and floor systems, considering the initial
   and recurring impacts from extraction to material replacement. Data were
   quantified using the CML 2001 method with OpenLCA 1.9 software. The
   analyzed impact categories are the potential for the depletion of
   abiotic resources-non-fossil (ADP); potential for the depletion of
   abiotic resources-fossil (ADP f); soil and water acidification potential
   (AP); eutrophication potential (EP); global warming potential-100 (GWP);
   stratospheric ozone layer depletion potential (ODP); and photochemical
   oxidation potential (POCP). The results highlight the impacts related to
   the maintenance and replacement of materials as the most significant,
   with walls being the system with the highest concentration of impacts,
   presenting the highest results among five of the seven categories. In
   the GWP category, the wall system resulted in 42\% of total impacts
   (initial + recurring impacts). These findings show that the selection
   and definition of construction materials in the design phase can either
   mitigate or exacerbate environmental burdens. Therefore, this research
   contribution lies in pinpointing the environmental impacts of each
   construction system of low-income housing to support architects and
   engineers in addressing environmental impacts when making project
   decisions.},

Volume = {193},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {This paper presents the first inventory and environmental impact study
   of the life cycle of coal obtained from a surface mine in Brazil.
   Significant reserves of coal in Brazil have attracted the attention of
   investors interested in building chemical and power generation plants.
   This inventory was developed to serve as a database for Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) studies, considering especially the impact of
   greenhouse gases, since there is no such information in the literature.
   The inventory collected data in situ, regarding the main pieces of
   equipment, inputs to the plant, and the direct emissions of greenhouse
   gases (GHG), covering different stages of the coal mining and
   processing, as well as the indirect emissions of GHG from the production
   and transportation of inputs. The coal life cycle emissions were equal
   to 3.29 x 10(-2) kg CO2eq per kg of coal, of which direct emissions
   accounted for 98.3\% of GHG, in which the major part was due to fugitive
   methane emissions from surface mining and post-mining coal crushing and
   handling operations. Additionally, the results of a sensitivity analysis
   showed that the diesel oil consumption was the most influential
   parameter of life cycle emission in terms of the inputs regarded. (C)

Abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment is a methodology that investigates impacts linked
   to a product or service during its entire life cycle. Life Cycle
   Assessment studies investigate processes and sub-processes in a
   fragmented way to ascertain their inputs, outputs and emissions and get
   an overview of the generating sources of their environmental loads. The
   lifecycle concept involves all direct and indirect processes of the
   studied object. This article aims to model the material flows in the
   masonry and drywall systems and internal walls in a Brazilian scenario,
   and calculate the climate change impacts generated by the transport of
   the component materials of the systems. Internal walls of a residential
   dwelling in Rio de Janeiro are analyzed from a qualitative inventory of
   all life cycles with an analysis of material flows, based on technical
   and academic literature. All Life Cycle Impact Assessment of the systems
   is carried out with international data from the database, and using the
   IPCC2013 method for climate change impacts. This study disregards the
   refurbishment and possible extensions within the use phase. Thus, the
   inventory identifies weaknesses of the systems while the impact
   assessment validates the results. This study allows us a complete
   understanding about the inner walls systems in the Brazilian scenario,
   evidencing its main weaknesses and subsidizes decision-making for the
   industry and for planning of the new buildings.},

Abstract = {Buildings are responsible for the energetic consumption and potential
   greenhouse gas emissions during their life cycle. Water heating system
   contribute to a building's energetic consumption, mainly in residential
   units, throughout the building's operational phase. Variability in
   energy sources, reservation and distribution systems of hot water along
   with the types of construction materials used in these building systems
   are key decisions to make in the initial design phases of a building
   project. Often, the definition of the most appropriate water heating
   system for a building is made via a technical-economic decision.
   However, the decision is rarely based on natural resource consumption
   and environmental impact generation throughout the life-cycle of the
   heating systems and of buildings as a whole. This study presents an
   application of a specific environmental management tool, based on an
   integrated Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Life-Cycle Analysis
   (LCA) method for selection of hot water systems, during the early design
   building phase. The proposed approach is implemented in the
   pre-operational phase, in order to enable decision makers to appreciate
   the resulting environmental performance of water heating systems in
   buildings. The applicability of the framework is tested via a
   comparative study of solar heating water systems and natural gas heating
   water systems for a residential multifamily building to be constructed
   in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. For the indicators damage to human health and
   damage to ecosystem, results indicate that the greatest impact on global
   warming comes from the natural gas heating system, while for solar
   heating, free particulate matter was the highest negative contribution.
   The operation phase for the natural gas system was highest for climate
   change while for solar heating system, it was the fresh water that was
   impacted the most during the pre-operational phase of the system's use.},

Title = {Different life cycle assessment methods and causes of variation in
   estimates of global warming in chicken and pork production systems: A
   critical systematic review},
Journal = {LIVESTOCK SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been widely used in recent years in
   swine and chicken production systems. This methodology aims to analyze
   the environmental aspects and measure the environmental impact of a
   product throughout its life cycle. Thus, this review will evaluate the
   application of life cycle assessment (LCA) in the Chicken and swine
   production system. to identify differences in LCA and explore the causes
   of variations between current works, main methodological differences in
   studies of the life cycle of swine and chickens, and explore the
   different values found in the literature in relation to greenhouse gas
   emissions for the same functional unit (FU). In swine and chicken
   production, values from 1.40 to 5.78 kgCO2-eq and 1.05 to 9.35 kgCO2-eq,
   per kg live weight, are observed, respectively. This variability occurs
   as a result of, some authors perform the calculation for only one
   production phase (for example, only the finishing phase without
   considering the sows that generated the piglets to be slaughtered);
   others carry out an evaluation of only one productive phase (piglets
   from 7 to 35 days of age). There are studies considering the addition of
   several factors, such as animal feed, water, housing and transport.
   Choices such as defining boundaries ({''}from cradle to farm gate{''} or
   ``from cradle to slaughter{''}), animal density, consideration of Land
   Use Change (LUC) and whether irrigation is used in grain production for
   animal feed often alter outcomes. The greatest impact of both production
   systems is associated with food - when LUC is added to the calculation,
   the impact is even more pronounced. The consideration of the LUC in soy
   production, especially in Brazil, is a recurring debate among the
   studies evaluated, about whether or not to include the deforestation
   factor; In conclusion, it is necessary to make the assessment as
   complete as possible, and the main objective of future studies should be
   to increase transparency regarding the criteria used in the LCAs.},

Title = {Modular steel panel for walls: life cycle environmental impact, life
   cycle cost, and potential for material circulation},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {267},
Number = {B},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {The impacts of civil construction are widely recognized and justify the
   transition from a linear to a circular economy. Furthermore, with
   building users increasingly demanding greater adaptability, strategies
   such as modularity and flexibility to adapt to changing uses are being
   discussed. Modular wall panels allow quick installation and have the
   potential for disassembly, refurbishment, reuse, and recycling. We
   evaluate a modular steel panel system in two Brazilian case studies
   through life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle cost (LCC), and building
   circularity index (BCI). The study applies the circular reuse and
   remanufacture, recycling, and life extension strategies for internal and
   external walls. For the external panel, the life extension strategy
   (SE02) stands out positively in all impact categories, with the lowest
   environmental impact and costs. However, the SE02 ` s BCI does not have
   the best result. The second best option is reuse (SE03), with the
   highest percentage of circularity. Furthermore, the differences between
   SE02 and SE03 are reduced in several impact categories, and the
   sensitivity analysis (transport, damage, and the number of reuses) shows
   that the differences could be even smaller. For the internal panel, life
   extension (SI02) and reuse (SI03) scenarios are the best options.
   Recycling (SI04) has the highest environmental impact and the best
   potential for circularity. BCI communication must be aligned with LCA
   and LCC, such that an increase in circularity is accompanied by a
   decrease in environmental impacts or with infeasible costs, especially
   for developing countries.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of medium-density fiberboard (MDF) manufacturing
   process in Brazil},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {575},
Pages = {103-111},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Brazil is one of the largest producers of medium-density fibreboard
   (MDF) in the world, and also the MDF has the highest domestic
   consumption and production rate in the country. MDF applications are
   highlighted into residential and commercial furniture design and also a
   wide participation in the building sector. This study aimed to propose
   ways of improving the environmental cradle-to-gate life-cycle of one
   cubic meter MDF panel by means of a life-cycle assessment (LCA) study.
   Complying with requirements of ISO 14040 and 14,044 standards, different
   MDF manufacturing scenarios were modelled using Umberto (R) v.5.6
   software and the Ecoinvent v.2.2 life-cycle inventory (LCI) database for
   the Brazilian context. Environmental and human health impacts were
   assessed by using the CML (2001) and USEtox (2008) methods. The
   evaluated impact categories were: acidification, global warming, ozone
   layer depletion, abiotic resource depletion, photochemical formation of
   tropospheric ozone, ecotoxicity, eutrophication and human toxicity.
   Results identified the following hotspots: gas consumption at the
   thermal plant, urea-formaldehyde resin, power consumption, wood chip
   consumption and wood chip transportation to the plant. The improvement
   scenario proposals comprised the following actions: eliminate natural
   gas consumption at the thermal plant, reduce electrical power
   consumption, reduce or replace urea-formaldehyde resin consumption,
   reduce wood consumption and minimize the distance to wood chip
   suppliers. The proposed actions were analysed to verify the influence of
   each action on the set of impact categories. Among the results, it can
   be noted that a joint action of the proposed improvements can result in
   a total reduction of up to 38.5\% of impacts to OD, 34.4\% to AD, 31.2\%
   to ET, and 30.4\% to HT. Finally, MDF was compared with particleboard
   production in Brazil, and additional opportunities to improve the MDF
   environmental profile were identified. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Using life cycle assessment to address stakeholders' potential for
   improving municipal solid waste management},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {35},
Number = {5},
Pages = {541-550},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Because the consumption of materials is generally higher than their
   recovery rate, improving municipal solid waste (MSW) management is
   fundamental for increasing the efficiency of natural resource use and
   consumption in urban areas. More broadly, the characteristics of a MSW
   management system influence the end-of-life (EOL) impacts of goods
   consumed by households. We aim to indicate the extent to which
   greenhouse gas emissions from a MSW management system can be reduced by
   increasing waste paper recycling. We also address the stakeholders'
   contribution for driving transition towards an improved scenario. Life
   cycle assessment (LCA) addresses the EOL impacts of the paper industry,
   driven by the characteristics of MSW management in Florianopolis,
   Brazil, by varying the level of stakeholders' commitment through
   different recycling scenarios. The results show that 41\% of the climate
   change impacts from waste paper management could be reduced when
   increasing the waste paper recycling rates and reducing waste paper
   landfilling. To achieve such emissions reduction, the industry
   contribution to the MSW management system would have to increase from
   17\% in the business-as-usual scenario to 74\% in the target scenario.
   We were able to measure the differences in stakeholders' contribution by
   modelling the MSW management system processes that are under the
   industry's responsibility separately from the processes that are under
   the government's responsibility, based on the Brazilian legal framework.
   The conclusions indicate that LCA can be used to support policy
   directions on reducing the impacts of MSW management by increasing
   resource recovery towards a circular economy.},

Title = {Analysis of the impacts of retrofit actions on the life cycle energy
   consumption of typical neighbourhood dwellings},

Abstract = {The residential sector is one of the most significant energy consumers
   and therefore contributes significantly to climate change. A study of
   not only the use of energy during the operation but also the associated
   consumption and emissions in the life cycle is required. One way to
   reduce life cycle energy consumption is through retro-fitting existing
   buildings. This study analysed the energy consumption and its greenhouse
   gas emissions after applying five sustainable retrofit measures. For
   this purpose, two typical neighbourhood dwellings were chosen, located
   in the city of Vitoria, in the state of Espirito Santo, Brazil. The
   analysis was conducted for the pre-operational and operational stages.
   Using pre-established standards, the energy of the building materials
   that compose the dwellings was calculated as well as the consumed
   operational energy. The labelling of the building envelopes was also
   verified, according to the simulation method specified by the Technical
   Quality Requirements for Energy Efficiency Levels of Residential
   Buildings (RTQ-R). The software programme used to calculate performance
   was EnergyPlus. The results indicated that adopting all retrofit
   measures yielded improvements in the life cycle for only one building,
   namely, a 15\% reduction in energy consumption and a payback time of
   10.4 years. Although these results are lower than those reported in some
   international studies, the analysis showed significant improvements in
   the operational stage of both buildings, in both labelling and energy
   consumption.},

Title = {Recognizing the wealth of non-marketable food in distribution centres:
   The environmental benefits of donation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {318},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {About one-third of annual global food production for human consumption
   is wasted, increasing the pressure on the environment in providing
   resources to support food supply-chains. Food waste reduction is of
   fundamental importance towards a more sustainable world, as recognized
   by the United Nations in the twelfth of its seventeen sustainable
   development goals for 2030. Among other practices, food donation appears
   as an alternative to overcome the existing social and environmental
   issues related to food waste, however, donation also causes
   environmental pressure by requiring additional energy investment on
   infrastructure and operational goods, while releasing gases to
   atmosphere, due to its processes. This work applies the life cycle
   assessment (LCA) method to evaluate the environmental impacts of
   plausible food donation scenarios in the `CEAGESP' food distribution
   center in Sao Paulo city, Brazil, the third largest in the world
   regarding marketable food (about 3 million tons/yr). Under the concept
   of waste hierarchy management options, six scenarios for the CEAGESP's
   non-marketable food (37,652 tons/yr) were established, from landfilling
   as a baseline to a donation alternative. Results show that donation
   scenarios have the least environmental burdens for all nine LCA impact
   categories. Worst-case scenarios were obtained by landfilling the
   non-marketable food, considering electricity generation or otherwise.
   Differences over tenfold in comparative bases among the best and
   worst-case scenarios were obtained by fossil depletion, global warming,
   human toxicity, water and metal depletion LCA's impact categories.
   Results highlight the environmental advantages of donating the
   non-marketable food of distribution centres, which is aligned with the
   concepts of circular and regenerative economy towards a sustainable
   development that should be promoted by public policies. Regional
   variables as the Brazilian electricity grid based on hydropower plants
   have considerable influence in some LCA impact categories, especially
   when accounting for the avoided emissions, emphasizing the importance of
   carrying out this study for Brazilian conditions.},

Abstract = {Purpose The building sector is one of the most relevant sectors in terms
   of environmental impact. Different functional units (FUs) can be used in
   life cycle assessment (LCA) studies for a variety of purposes. This
   paper aimed to present different FUs used in the LCA of buildings and
   evaluate the influence of FU choice and setting in comparative studies.
   Methods As an example, we compared the ``cradle to grave{''}
   environmental performance of four typical Brazilian residential
   buildings with different construction typologies, i.e., multi-dwelling
   and single dwelling, each with high and basic standards. We chose three
   types of FU for comparison: a dwelling with defined lifetime and
   occupancy parameters, an area of 1 m(2) of dwelling over a year period,
   and the accommodation of an occupant person of the dwelling over a day.
   Results and discussion The FU choice was found to bias the results
   considerably. As expected, the largest global warming indicator (GWi)
   values per dwelling unit and occupant were identified for the high
   standard dwellings. However, when measured per square meter, lower
   standard dwellings presented the largest GWi values. This was caused by
   the greater concentration of people per square meter in smaller area
   dwellings, resulting in larger water and energy consumption per square
   meter. The sensitivity analysis of FU variables such as lifetime and
   occupancy showed the GWi contribution of the infrastructure more
   relevant compared with the operation in high and basic standard
   dwellings. The definition of lifetime and occupancy parameters is key to
   avoid bias and to reduce uncertainty of the results when performing a
   comparison of dwelling environmental performances. Conclusions This
   paper highlights the need for adequate choice and setting of FU to
   support intended decision-making in LCA studies of the building sector.
   The use of at least two FUs presented a broader picture of building
   performance, helping to guide effective environmental optimization
   efforts from different approaches and levels of analysis. Information
   regarding space, time, and service dimensions should be either included
   in the FU setting or provided in the building LCA study to allow
   adjustment of the results for subsequent comparison.},

Abstract = {The replacement of plumbing fixtures is a regular practice in the
   implementation of water conservation programmes in existing buildings.
   However, even though such programmes aim at reducing water consumption,
   it is necessary to understand the environmental implications of the
   replacement of ordinary plumbing fixtures with water-saving versions.
   The feasibility of such a practice, in terms of environmental aspects,
   should be evaluated in order to verify its effectiveness. This paper
   describes the application of a methodology to evaluate the environmental
   impacts involved in the replacement of ordinary taps with water-saving
   ones based on life-cycle assessment. The method quantifies inputs and
   outputs in the production, use, and disposal phases of the plumbing
   fixtures under analysis. The impact categories considered are global
   warming potential, depletion of the ozone layer, human toxicity,
   acidification, water consumption, and energy consumption. In order to
   assess the economic impacts, Life Cycle Cost methodology was applied.
   The method was applied in a water conservation programme of a university
   campus in Southern Brazil. The results indicate that the use phase of
   both ordinary and water-saving taps present strong influence in four
   impact categories (global warming potential, depletion of the ozone
   layer, water consumption, and energy consumption). Life Cycle Cost was
   estimated as R\$245.99 and R\$316.20 for the ordinary and water-saving
   taps, respectively. Such results show that the adoption of water-saving
   taps is not economically feasible without incentives from the public
   sector. On the other hand, the environmental performance of the
   water-saving tap was superior for all environmental impact categories
   analysed herein. The results indicate that the replacement of ordinary
   taps with water-saving taps would reduce water consumption by 26.2\%,
   energy consumption by 13.6\%, human toxicity by 4.6\%, acidification by
   0.2\%, global warming potential by 14.8\% and depletion of the ozone
   layer by 15.8\%. Although the replacement of ordinary taps is not
   economically feasible, the use of water-saving taps is recommended on
   the campus where the study was conducted based on the environmental
   impacts in the life cycle. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The objective of this paper is to present and to apply a method based on
   Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) which was used to assess the environmental
   performance of hybrid rainwater-greywater systems in residential
   buildings. The method was applied in a case study in single-family
   residences in southern Brazil. The environmental impacts of two
   scenarios were compared: a house with a decentralized hybrid
   rainwater-greywater system and the same house with a conventional
   centralized water system. SimaPro software was used for environmental
   impact analysis and ReCiPe was used as an assessment tool. The average
   potential for potable water savings through the implementation of the
   hybrid rainwater-greywater system was 41.9\%, the potential for domestic
   sewage reduction was 40\% and the total energy consumption reduction in
   comparison to the conventional system scenario was 36.1\%. The most
   significant environmental impacts in the assessment of the life cycle
   were related to the operational phase. The energy savings in the
   operation phase is essential to minimize the impacts observed and to
   maximize the sustainability and potential benefits. The findings of this
   study indicate that the scenario with hybrid rainwater-greywater system
   represents the most environmentally favourable option in single-family
   residences. The method is easy to adapt to different regions and can
   support designers and decision makers aiming to improve the performance
   of existing and new hybrid rainwater-greywater systems. It may also
   contribute to the recommendation of potential environmental mitigation
   measures and to the development of specific public policies to encourage
   the residential use of alternative water sources.},

Number = {17},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The use of plumbing fixtures to promote water saving in the built
   environment is a common practice in water conservation programs.
   However, the environmental implications of fixtures replacement should
   be taken into consideration. This paper analyzes three different
   scenarios for the provision of water in toilets installed in a
   university campus. In scenarios 1 and 2, single flush and dual flush
   devices were installed in the toilets, respectively. In scenario 3, in
   addition to the installation of dual flush devices, a greywater reuse
   system from the lavatories was analyzed. The objective is to evaluate,
   through the Life Cycle Assessment, the environmental aspects related to
   these scenarios. The economic analysis of the three scenarios was also
   carried out. Measurements were taken on all plumbing fixtures installed
   in a building of a university campus in Southern Brazil. The research
   was conducted using smart meters in two periods: with single flush and
   dual flush devices installed in toilets. Considering the environmental
   impacts analyzed, scenario 3 presented lower water and energy
   consumption in the life cycle. Scenario 2, however, presented lower
   global warming potential. The net present value results were R\$
   23,575.71, R\$ 19,091.41, and R\$ 22,500.55 for scenarios 1, 2 and 3,

Title = {Consequential life cycle assessment of bamboo leaf ash generation: A
   Brazilian context},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {470},
Month = {SEP 10},
Abstract = {The potential of biomass growth, such as from bamboo leaves, as a source
   of electricity provides an optimistic scenario for the sustainable
   development of new green building materials. To validate robust life
   cycle inventory (LCI) data for incoming high-quality silica sources for
   cementitious materials, a consequential life cycle assessment (CLCA) on
   the bamboo leaves ash (BLA) with a prospective approach was conducted.
   The LCI data was collected in Southeastern Brazil with a prospective
   maturity in biomass electricity system. The data was gathered by
   analyzing the various stages involved in the production of BLA,
   including bamboo cultivation, leaf collection, cogeneration, raw BLA
   beneficiation, and its impact on cement and electricity marginal
   production systems. According to the multifunctionality solution, the
   environmental impacts results of CLCA were discussed using a sensibility
   analysis with two attributional life cycle assessment (ALCA) scenarios
   as allocation and ``zero environmental load{''} (considering BLA as
   residue). The scenarios demonstrate the potential for sustainable use of
   BLA, especially for its impact on climate change, including the biogenic
   carbon category. Also, consequences such as avoiding BLA landfilling and
   increasing the potential for bamboo agricultural holdings to become
   energy independent was included in the study conclusion. While these
   results are positive, the prospect of maturing electricity production
   requires the development of other high-quality materials, such as
   sugarcane bagasse ash, sugarcane leaf ash and rice husk ash. However,
   the positives consequences did not overcome the negative impacts from
   the transportation of BLA into its system boundaries, once the highway
   transport model is the manly in the Brazilian context. Hence, this study
   provides important and reproducible pathways for developing LCI data on
   other biomass ashes, assisting future studies on green building
   materials.},

Title = {Increasing the sustainability potential of a reinforced concrete
   building through design strategies: Case study},
Journal = {CASE STUDIES IN CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper aims to investigate the influence of design strategies on the
   economic and environmental performance of 30-storey residential
   reinforced concrete (RC) building located in the Southern Brazil,
   through a case study. Four design options are simulated for the same
   building, including structural design as rigid frame system or hinged
   frame system with second order/P delta effects. In both cases buildings
   were designed with concrete strength class 25 MPa (C25) applied in all
   the structural elements or a concrete strength class range of 50 MPa to
   25 MPa (C25-050) applied in columns, varying along the building height.
   Environmental impacts were quantified through Life Cycle Assessment
   (LCA) based on measurements of environmental loads of processes and
   products, from cradle to grave. Results show reduction of environmental
   impacts, embodied energy and construction costs when a decrease in the
   amount of steel is combined with the increase in the concrete
   compressive strength of columns, which is more representative for the
   building designed as hinged frame system. The production of materials
   phase showed to be the major contributor to environmental impacts with
   steel and concrete being the most relevant impact producers. Concrete
   represents important impacts for stratospheric ozone depletion and
   climate change while steel dominates the ecotoxicity-related indicators.
   Results highlight the importance of design strategies to increase the
   sustainability potential of a RC structure and contribute to consolidate
   contemporary approaches that suggest the need to incorporate the degree
   of environmental impacts in design methods. (C) 2018 Published by

Abstract = {Considering the importance of the development of new housing projects,
   the purpose of this research is to provide a model oriented to the
   identification of the most sustainable alternative in single-family
   housing projects of social interest from the perspective of life cycle
   thinking (LCT) and the analytical hierarchical process (AHP). A ceramic
   masonry project and a concrete masonry project were evaluated. In the
   environmental dimension, the results showed that the ceramic masonry
   project had more significant environmental impacts and greater damage to
   human health and the availability of resources and ecosystems. In the
   social dimension, it was found that there are discrepancies between the
   salaries in the construction supply chain and that the concrete masonry
   project had better social characteristics than the ceramic masonry
   project. The economic dimension revealed that the concrete masonry
   project was more attractive. Relating the environmental, social, and
   economic dimensions' results, through the combination of LCT and AHP, it
   was found that the concrete masonry project presented a combination of
   more sustainable characteristics than the ceramic masonry project in the
   majority of the results. Among the implications of the study carried out
   here is the advancement of sustainability applied to the construction
   sector.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of on-site source-separated wastewater
   treatment and reuse systems for resource recovery in a sustainable
   sanitation view},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {895},
Month = {JUN 24},
Abstract = {Sustainable sanitation solutions are necessary for promoting public
   health and environmental security. In this study, on-site domestic
   wastewater treatment (WWT) systems used for households in rural and
   peri-urban areas of Brazil were compared in different scenarios from a
   life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective. The evaluated scenarios
   repre-sented different practices in wastewater management, such as
   direct discharge into the soil, rudimentary treatment, septic tank,
   public sewerage system, and source separation of wastewater streams for
   water, nutrient, and organic mat-ter recovery. The WWT technologies
   considered in the proposed scenarios of source-separated wastewater
   streams were as follows: an evapotranspiration tank (TEvap) and
   composting toilet for blackwater, a modified constructed wetland
   (EvaTAC) for greywater, and a storage tank for urine. LCA was performed
   in this study according to the ISO standards to assess the environmental
   impacts at both midpoint and endpoint levels. The results show that on -
   site source-separated wastewater treatment systems with resource
   recovery result in significant reductions in environ-mental impacts
   compared to scenarios with precarious conditions or `end-of-pipe'
   solutions. For example, regarding the human health damage category, the
   scenarios involving resource recovery, including systems such as EvaTAC,
   TEvap, composting toilet, and urine storage tank, demonstrate
   significantly lower values (-0.0117 to -0.0115 DALY) compared to
   scenarios with rudimentary cesspits and septic tanks (0.0003 to 0.001
   DALY). We conclude that the focus should be beyond mere pollution
   aspects and instead concentrate on the benefits of the co-products,
   which are: avoiding the extraction and consumption of valuable and
   increasingly scarce raw materials, such as potable water, and production
   of synthetic fertilizer. Furthermore, it is highly recommended that an
   LCA of sanitation systems synergistically integrates the WWT process,
   the constructive aspects, and the resource recovery potential.},

Title = {Life cycle assessment of the ornamental stone processing waste use in
   cement-based building materials},
Journal = {CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {257},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Laboratory technical studies demonstrate the feasibility of using the
   ornamental stone processing waste (OSPW) for construction and building
   materials manufacturing. However, regarding the environmental aspect,
   there is still the need to justify its use quantitatively. Thus, this
   study presents the life cycle assessment (LCA) of using OSPW for
   cement-based building materials manufacturing, aiming to assess OSPW
   influence on environmental impact indicators (global warming potential,
   embodied energy and total impact). Altogether, 127 mixtures are
   analyzed, such as mortars, concretes, masonry and paving blocks. The
   impacts of OSPW drying and logistics are presented, as well as the
   impacts of the process (burning) to produce the heat-treated waste
   (HTOSPW). The results indicate that OSPW is a good alternative to reduce
   environmental impacts in the analyzed scenario (Espirito Santo (ES)
   state - Brazil), as a replacement for limestone filler, sand or stone
   dust. OSPW could be used as a cement partial replacement and presented
   satisfactory environmental results at high replacement levels (over
   50\%) in the production of self-compacting concrete, rendering and
   masonry mortars. The results also show that the artificial drying
   alternatives greatly increase the OSPW impact. Regarding the production
   of the mixtures, cement replacement was the approach most commonly used,
   causing a reduction in environmental impact indicators of 7.7 to 9.0\%
   for each 10\% of OSPW use. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An analysis of Brazilian raw cow milk production systems and

Abstract = {The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to provide an LCA of raw cow milk
   production systems from the two most representative states (Paran acute
   accent a and Minas Gerais) for milk production in Brazil considering
   four impact categories according to product category rules of raw milk;
   and (ii) to analyze the environmental performance of milk produced in
   Brazil (at the farm-gate) with that of milk produced in other parts of
   the world (at the farm-gate) based on valid EPDs of processed whole milk
   and LCA studies of milk in the existing literature. For building life
   cycle inventories, agricultural processes and activities associated with
   milk production were mapped out. Three milk production systems in Brazil
   were assessed, one confined, and two semi-confined, in two different
   regions, within Minas Gerais and Paran acute accent a states. The
   functional unit used in this study was 1 kg of fat and protein corrected
   milk. Moreover, an analysis of the environmental performance of milk
   produced in Brazil with that of milk produced in other parts of the
   world based on valid EPDs of processed milk was made. LCA results and
   the results obtained from the valid EPDs used different life cycle
   impact assessment methods (IPCC 2013; CML, ReCiPE) and impact categories
   (climate change, acidification potential, eutrophication, formation
   potential of tropospheric ozone). The raw milk (cradle-to-farm-gate)
   produced in Brazil (in different states and based on different systems
   -confined or semi-confined) has lower environmental impacts when
   associated with those (cradle-to-farm-gate) of published EPDs. The study
   also briefly compared the results of Brazilian milk production systems
   with cradle-to-farm-gate LCAs of raw milk found in the literature, and
   discussed a few strategies for the Brazilian market of milk and dairy
   products. MPS in Brazil can serve as a benchmark for MPS in other
   countries, and EPDs can add transparency to business-to-business and
   business-to-consumer relations.},

Title = {Environmental impact of Brazilian broiler production process: Evaluation
   using life cycle assessment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {237},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {The environmental management of the broiler production chain should
   include assessments that more accurately detail the processes that occur
   on the farm related to the broiler life cycle. The present study meant
   to evaluate the environmental impact of the production process of
   broiler using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach. The life cycle
   inventory included all inflows and outflows of the subsystems:
   feed-ration production and broiler grow-out, with system boundary from
   the housing of the chick from one-day to the live broiler produced in
   the farm gate, and the functional unit of the ``1-kg live weight.{''}
   The impacts categories evaluated were: Global Warming Potential in
   hundred years (GWP), depletion of abiotic resources (mineral elements
   and fossil fuels), depletion of the ozone layer, eutrophication,
   acidification, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic
   ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity, human toxicity, photochemical
   oxidation, and land use. The results showed that total emissions of
   greenhouse gases (GHG) (CH4, and N2O) from the management of manure in
   broiler farms totaled 0.154 kg CO2-eq per kg of live weight produced.
   The total GWP for the broiler production process was 2.70 kg CO2-eq per
   kg of live weight produced. The depletion of abiotic resources (mineral
   elements) and depletion of abiotic resources - fossil fuels presented
   higher values for the feed-ration production phase. The marine aquatic
   ecotoxicity category and the GWP are the most impacting categories. The
   broiler grow-out mainly influences these categories during the
   production process. Results showed that broiler rearing is the subsystem
   within meat production that gives the highest environmental impact.
   However, considering the characteristics of the studied system, the
   level of technology applied, and the local availability of grains used
   in the feed ration reduces the use of energy in the transport and
   processing of the feed. The present study indicates the best strategies
   to improve the environmental performance of broiler meat production. (C)

Abstract = {The main objective of this work is to assess the environmental impact
   and investment feasibility analysis of rainwater harvesting systems for
   a low-cost house located in Florianopolis, southern Brazil, by using the
   concepts of Life Cycle Analysis (LCA). The environmental and investment
   feasibility analysis was performed for two scenarios, i.e., a scenario
   in which there is only a potable water system supplied by the water
   utility, and another scenario in which the potable water system is
   complemented by rainwater. Three types of rainwater storage tanks were
   analysed: plastic reinforced with glass fibre, high density polyethylene
   and reinforced concrete. Results indicate that plastic tanks reinforced
   with glass fibre are environmentally more feasible, while concrete tanks
   are economically more feasible. This study showed the importance of
   analysing environmental and economic aspects before implementing a
   system with rainwater utilization; thus better choices regarding the
   materials used in the systems, aiming at sustainability in buildings,
   can be made.},

Abstract = {In continental countries, building materials are often moved over long
   distances from factories to building sites. This is especially important
   when quality and performance certification systems are required for the
   building materials' acquisition. In this scenario, the transportation
   phase tends to have a great contribution to building materials'
   environmental impacts. Taking into consideration that countries such as
   China, India, and Brazil, i.e., continental countries, are expecting the
   largest future housing demand, the issue of transportation will have a
   crucial role in environmental impacts. Through a Brazilian case study,
   the present work investigates the potential environmental impacts of
   structural masonry made of concrete and ceramic blocks certified by the
   Brazilian Quality Program. A cradle-to-site Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)
   is carried out while considering a country-level approach using data
   from the literature and Ecoinvent. The results show that ceramic blocks
   are preferable for most states and scenarios. Human Health and Ecosystem
   Quality are the two categories most affected by transportation, and they
   can reach more than 96\% and 99\%, respectively. The efficiency of the
   building material transportation system plays an important role in
   reducing greenhouse gas emissions. A shift in building components from
   concrete to ceramic blocks has the potential to mitigate between 154 and
   229 Mt CO2-eq between 2020 and 2050. The methodological approach used in
   this work can be applied to other building materials and other
   countries, especially those of continental dimensions that are expected
   to have a significant future housing demand.},

Title = {Rainwater harvesting through roofs and stormwater harvesting through
   pervious pavements: A Life Cycle Assessment and decision-making
   comparison},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {476},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Water consumption and the building sector are among the top contributors
   to environmental impacts worldwide. Also, sustainable practices have
   been constantly encouraged in both sectors to mitigate water scarcity
   and provide resilience to cities. Thus, studies that provide an
   environmental assessment and discuss the decisionmaking process are
   essential for enabling the augmentation of sustainable practices. This
   research aims to contribute to the discussion on sustainability by
   conducting a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Sustainable Urban Drainage
   Systems (SUDS) examples. LCA is the main methodology applied to perform
   environmental comparisons. First, a thorough inventory was obtained from
   previous works with different alternatives for water management within a
   university building, including drainage, paving and water supply
   functions. The inventory contemplates alternatives using rainwater and
   stormwater harvesting for non-potable water supply, including pervious
   pavements. Such alternatives were compared with Brazil's usual water
   supply systems, aiming at diminishing the total environmental burden.
   The methodology aspects of LCA were also regarded, such as an
   uncertainty assessment and a quality matrix of the processes used.
   Midpoint and endpoint categories were also regarded with their
   decision-making and uncertainty analysis. The main result is the
   understanding of the tradeoffs between the proposed systems, with a
   significant reduction in water stress obtained in the alternative
   scenarios. However, such a decrease is accompanied by a slight increase
   in some impact categories. Rainwater harvesting through roofs is the
   most environmentally friendly alternative, although the Cultural Theory
   parameter definition impacts on the sustainability ranking. Alternative
   sustainable systems for water management still need validation in terms
   of LCA, while decision-making for sustainable and resilient cities also
   requires a robust scientific basis. Thus, in conclusion, alternative
   systems such as SUDS were obtained to be more sustainable than
   conventional paving, drainage and water supply in the case study, and
   the understanding of different benefits found in the LCA is important to
   the decision-making process.},

Title = {Sustainable energy performance in Brazilian social housing: A proposal
   for a Sustainability Index in the energy life cycle considering climate
   change},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {The main goal of this research is the proposal of an integrated
   approach, considering sustainability indicators related to energy life
   cycle of the building, for evaluation of energy efficiency measures with
   adaptation to climate change in Brazilian social housing projects. A
   Sustainability Index in the Energy Life Cycle was proposed that includes
   indicators associated to environmental, energy, economic aspects and
   user thermal comfort. A case study applied in the city of Sao Paulo,
   considered a representative project of the sector and cases with energy
   efficiency adaptation measures for three climate scenarios, considering
   climate change. The integrated approach highlighted the importance of
   the initial selection of materials, considering their associated impacts
   as well as the thermal and energy performance of the building during its
   life time, and the importance of climate change for the operational
   phase of the building. With the Sustainability Index in the Energy Life
   Cycle, large reductions were obtained comparing cases with adaptation
   measures to current practice. Results of this research contribute to
   improve project's decisions with the incorporation of a holistic
   approach for the projects that are being produced for the housing
   deficit, considering better energy performance and lower resource
   consumption for users and the country in the long term.

Title = {The carbon footprint appraisal of local visitor travel in Brazil: A case
   of the Rio de Janeiro-Sao Paulo itinerary},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {141},
Pages = {256-266},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Tourism transportation contributes substantially to the global carbon
   footprint. This contribution is predicted to enlarge, especially in
   `emerging' tourism markets, and hence urgent carbon mitigation is
   necessary. Effective mitigation is determined by reliable carbon
   footprint assessments whose number is however limited, particularly for
   developing countries with growing tourism. This study applied the life
   cycle assessment (LCA) based method to appraise the carbon significance
   of various transport modes between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, the key
   itinerary for travel with leisure and tourism purposes by local
   residents and overseas visitors in Brazil. Given the envisaged rise in
   biofuel use in the Brazilian transportation sector, this study is unique
   in that it evaluated the carbon reduction potential offered by biofuel.
   The study demonstrated that overland public transport represents the
   most carbon-efficient mode of local transportation. It further
   highlighted the crucial role of biofuel in minimising the carbon
   intensity of transportation between Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo.
   Policy-making and managerial recommendations were put forward to
   facilitate more climate-benign local transportation practices. (C) 2016

Title = {Environmental assessment of a permeable pavement system used to harvest
   stormwater for non-potable water uses in a building},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {746},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {The objective of this work is to present and to apply a method to
   environmentally evaluate a permeable pavement system used to harvest
   stormwater for non-potable water uses in a building. Two pavement
   systems were compared through life cycle assessment (LCA). The first
   system consists of a permeable pavement; in this case, the stormwater
   filtered by the pavement is used for non-potable water purposes in a
   building. The second system consists of a flexible pavement
   (impermeable), with no stormwater harvesting, and with conventional
   water supply in the building. The method was applied in a case study in
   a public building in southern Brazil. Water consumption surveys were
   made and the potential for potable water and electricity savings in the
   building were estimated. In the inventory, input and output data related
   to each stage of the life cycle of the systems were gathered and
   quantified. In the impact assessment, it was found that, for both
   pavement systems, the most significant damages were related to the
   implementation and end-of-life stages. The permeable pavement system
   presented a lower potential for environmental impacts in most midpoint
   categories evaluated, and also lower overall potential impact in the
   endpoint approach. The results also showed that the categories with the
   greatest environmental impact for both systems were fine particulate
   matter formation and global warming. The method proposed can be used as
   a basis for guiding planning and decision-making to improve water
   infrastructure management through stormwater harvesting in urban
   centres. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Is the Soil-Cement Brick an Ecological Brick? An Analysis of the Life
   Cycle Environmental and Energy Performance of Masonry Walls},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Masonry wall is a key construction subsystem, but it embodies
   significant environmental and energy burdens within the life cycle of
   buildings. Soil-cement bricks and blocks stand as an alternative
   low-cost masonry material, but despite the widespread claim to be
   environmentally friendly, more systematic investigation is lacking. This
   study aimed to assess the life cycle environmental and energy
   performance of 1.0 m(2) of a soil-cement brick masonry wall from
   cradle-to-construction in terms of carbon, energy, and water footprints,
   and fossil and mineral resource use, as well as compare it with
   conventional technologies such as ceramic and concrete block masonries
   in Brazil. Results showed that raw materials are a major contribution to
   soil cement masonry walls, followed by the joints and links with
   columns, in which cement stands out among other inputs. Hydraulic
   pressing in brick production had a negligible burden increase compared
   with manual pressing. The PVA mortar joint outperformed the PVA glue
   one, whereas resin coating performed better than cement mortar. In
   comparison with ceramic and concrete masonry walls, the soil cement
   masonry presented overall better environmental and energy performance
   and was the least affected by the inclusion of finishing coating layers
   and transport of materials in the sensitivity analysis scenarios,
   although improved scenarios of conventional options could be
   competitive, e.g., ceramic masonry with blocks produced by firing
   reforested wood for the carbon footprint. Scale-up analysis revealed
   that widespread deployment of soil cement masonry in the built
   environment would substantially avoid environmental and energy burdens
   compared with conventional technologies.},

Title = {Environmental evaluation of 3D printed concrete walls considering the
   life cycle perspective in the context of social housing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Wall construction is the most common application for 3D concrete
   printing (3DCP). This construction technique requires a printing
   material with specific rheological characteristics that are usually
   achieved through high cement consumptions, reaching more than 1000
   kg/m3. It is well known that large-scale cement consumption is a
   worldwide concern, mainly due to carbon dioxide emissions. Thus, in the
   context of 3DCP structures, this environmental concern becomes even more
   relevant. Therefore, this work investigated the environmental
   performance, by means of the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology,
   evaluating 14 environmental impact categories of 3DCP walls, and
   comparing them with conventional construction techniques in a social
   housing context of a Brazilian case study. The results confirmed that
   cement consumption provides the greatest contribution to the impact
   potentials for most of the evaluated categories, reaching 93\% for
   climate change. So, materials that can be used to replace cement, such
   as supplementary cementitious materials (SCM), are important
   alternatives. In general, the comparative results showed that 3DCP can
   have a similar environmental performance to conventional construction
   techniques, when, instead of evaluating 1 m3 of concrete, the functional
   unit evaluated is 1 m2 of wall. Sensitivity analysis carried out showed
   that the printing parameter variations that most affect the consumption
   of concrete cause the greatest changes in potential environmental
   impacts, while alterations in the energy consumption, almost do not
   influence the total values of the potential impacts. Finally, this study
   presents a roadmap and a pathway for designers, developers, builders and
   researchers of 3DCP to decrease the life cycle environmental impacts.},

Abstract = {Coatings play a fundamental role in the exterior wall system of a
   building and are directly related to its performance through life.
   Increased durability and lifespan can be achieved when coating's
   integrity can prevent the entrance of aggressive agents on the
   substrate. Therefore, the condition of this system should be
   periodically evaluated, considering not only technical and economic
   aspects in the selection of the materials for repair, but also
   sustainability aspects, in order to reduce the environmental impacts
   incorporated into the building. In this study, a Brazilian building
   dated from 1908 was evaluated with the purpose of detecting pathological
   manifestations in its outer coating. In a primarily inspection stage,
   cracks and coating detachments were identified as the pathological
   manifestations with higher incidence in the evaluated facades. Three
   maintenance strategies were assessed for crack repair and two for the
   purpose of resolving the loss of adhesion. Subsequently, a life cycle
   analysis (LCA) was performed for each intervention alternative. Results
   indicate that regarding the cracks correction, the solution that
   presented the lowest environmental impact potential was the model that
   uses lime paste for filling, while for detachments the indicated
   solution from an environmental point of view is the polymer-free model.},

Abstract = {The building sector is one of the largest consumers of natural resources
   and energy in the world. Strategies to improve the energy efficiency are
   a solution to improve the performance of a building. However, in most

   building. The life-cycle energy analysis can be an important tool to
   allow choosing the best strategy. The objective of this paper is to
   assess the energy performance of four window shading systems in a house
   using life-cycle energy analysis. Life-cycle cost analysis was also used
   to determine not only the most energy-efficient strategy, but also the
   most economically feasible one. A house located in Florianopolis,
   southern Brazil, was evaluated based on a 63-year lifespan. The four
   window shadings analysed were: punctured concrete blocks, aluminium
   double sliding shutters, PVC roller shutters and wooden double open
   shutters. The EnergyPlus computer programme was used to estimate only
   the annual energy consumption for air-conditioning with and without the
   shading strategies. National and international databases were used to
   perform the life-cycle analysis. For the life cycle cost analysis, the
   cost of each strategy was obtained through a survey in local stores. The
   average inflation rate in the last ten years in Brazil was used to
   estimate the future costs. The results showed that the use of wooden
   double open shutters and PVC roller shutters are the most suitable
   solutions for window shading, both in terms of energy and costs, if they
   are not replaced during the lifespan of the building. This paper pointed
   out the need of using the proposed methodology to assure the right
   choice of strategies for energy efficiency in buildings. (C) 2016

Abstract = {Environmental Product Declaration (EPD) and EPD-like demands have been
   gaining importance, particularly due to the release of Product
   Environmental Footprint by the European Union (EU). EPDs could be
   demanded in international trade, potentially creating a technical trade
   barrier for emerging economy countries. Thus, those countries should
   evaluate their readiness to successfully meet this demand. In this
   sense, this paper aims to analyse and propose strategies for EPD
   promotion in Brazil. Brazil's situation regarding life cycle assessment
   (LCA) and EPD development was analysed considering its business,
   academic, public policy and consumers contexts. In addition, an analysis
   of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) was
   elaborated based on interviews with EPD stakeholders in the country.
   These allowed some strategies to be proposed considering the principle
   of connecting strengths and opportunities, compensating for weaknesses
   and neutralizing threats. The results showed that Brazil has a technical
   and institutional context that enables EPD growth due to the initial
   stage of LCA database, EPD programs, stakeholders' engagement, and
   availability of experts. However, in general, these aspects aren't in an
   adequate level for successful EPD promotion. There is still a large path
   for EPD understanding and life cycle data availability. Besides,
   financial and technical restriction, especially considering small and
   medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), present structural barriers.
   Nevertheless, by promoting EPD, Brazil could have gains in terms of
   credibility, access to global markets and environmental awareness. The
   opposite could happen if the country doesn't seize these opportunities.
   Furthermore, to influence Product Category Rule (PCR) definitions was
   said to be a key opportunity to avoid rules that disregard Brazilian
   singularities. Strategies for EPD promotion should focus on sensitizing
   and engaging different stakeholders in strategic sectors (civil
   construction, paper and pulp, coffee, ingredients derived from soya and
   livestock), enhancing technical capacities and life cycle data
   generation, and strengthening EPD programs to boost the Brazilian
   internal market and PCR development. Brazilian institutions should be
   encouraged to follow international discussions on EPD and internalize
   them, fostering sustainable production and consumption in the country.

Abstract = {The increase in the cultivation of sugarcane for energy purposes has
   raised awareness regarding the possibilities of mitigating the
   associated environmental impacts. This study applies the Life Cycle
   Assessment (LCA) methodology to quantify and compare the environmental
   impacts associated with the use of commercial chemical fertilization and
   industrial biosolids in the production of sugarcane. LCA was developed
   with the SimaPro (R) software, utilizing the Ecoinvent and
   Agri-footprint databases. The environmental impact assessment methods
   employed were the IPCC 2013 GWP 100y and Eco-indicator 99. An experiment
   was devised at an experimental farm located in Northeast Brazil,
   considering 1 ha cultivated with sugarcane. For commercial chemical
   fertilization, local management practices were followed. The biosolid
   was applied in the exact dosage recommended by Brazilian regulation,
   ``biosolid 1x{''}. This amount was then multiplied by two, four, and
   eight, totalling four scenarios. The environmental loads generated in
   the cultivation of sugarcane decreased with the application of
   ``biosolid 1x{''}. All biosolid dosages tested reached higher production
   values than commercial chemical fertilization. The application of
   biosolid as a fertilizer contributed to addressing the issue of its
   correct disposal and is a promising alternative for the development of
   more sustainable and productive energy systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {57},

Abstract = {The Brazilian government has started up a large social housing program
   for low-income families. Considering the large investment for this
   program, it is important to analyse the environmental impact to create a
   base for further improvement assessment. The goal of this paper is to
   visualise the energy use (embodied and operational) during the life
   cycle of case study for a house in the social housing program. The case
   study showed that the embodied energy (EE) is 7.2 GJ/m(2) or 30\% of the
   total energy from the life cycle, the operational energy is 17.5
   GJ/m(2). Half of the Embodied Energy is due to material use for
   maintenance and around 57\% of the embodied energy is used in the wall
   construction. Compared to other international studies (5.8 GJ/m(2) per
   50 years), the embodied energy is relative high (7.2 GJ/m(2) per 50
   years) whereas the operational energy is only the half (17.5 compared to
   36 GJ/m(2) per 50 year). The study indicates that the largest
   improvement potential for reducing the embodied energy is connected to
   the walls trough choosing materials and systems with less Embodied
   Energy and higher durability to decrease the need for maintenance and
   substitution of materials. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Acai seed ash (ASA) is a waste product from processing the acai fruit
   and burning the seeds for cogeneration purposes. The present study
   evaluated the use of ASA from the Brazilian Amazon as partial Portland
   cement replacement in self-leveling mortars (SLM) for social-interest
   buildings. The fresh and hardened state properties of mortars were
   accessed with 5\% and 10\% ASA content, and a life cycle assessment was
   performed to evaluate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The maximum
   transport distance to enable ASA as a building material was determined
   by a sensitivity analysis, and specific carbon-efficiency indicators for
   SLM were proposed and validated. The results showed that using up to
   10\% ASA as cement replacement was technically and environmentally
   feasible since the mechanical performance was maintained and GHG
   emissions decreased up to 8\%. The sensitivity analysis revealed that
   transport efficiency is crucial for ASA applications far from its
   production area; therefore, it should be evaluated as a regional
   building material. The work brings an important contribution to regional
   sustainable development by assessing the characteristics of a residual
   material and proposing the reuse of waste, reducing GHG emissions from
   the cement industry, and stimulating the circular bioeconomy in the
   Brazilian Amazon region.},

Abstract = {Concern in relation to creating environmental protection policies is
   increasing, particularly with regard to the reuse of waste for power
   generation. In this context, biodiesel production from waste cooking
   oils could play an important role. Biodiesel is a biofuel that can be
   produced from saturated fatty raw material discarded by restaurants,
   such as oils and fats used for cooking processes. This paper describes a
   biodiesel production plant installed at Pinheira Beach in the State of
   Santa Catarina, southern Brazil and aims to discuss the environmental,
   social and economic impacts by analyzing the biodiesel production by
   life cycle assessment (LCA), relationship with the emission of
   greenhouse gases. The plant is run by an association and is aimed at
   promoting the recycling of waste cooking oil from restaurants and
   residences in the area and, at the same time, enables the continuity of
   artisanal fisheries in the region. The transesterification production
   process was used to convert waste cooking oils into biodiesel using
   basic catalysis in the presence of methanol. A batch system with the
   capacity to produce 200 L of biodiesel per day was adopted. The data
   obtained for the biodiesel produced at the plant were 879.2 kg m(-3)
   density, 495.74 mg kg(-1) water content, 94.38\% ester content, and 1.5
   mg.kg(-1) sodium plus potassium. Related to the Life Cycle Assessment
   the results demonstrate that the category that most contributes to the
   emissions generated in biodiesel production process is the collection
   stage with 92.10\% contribution, presenting a significant difference to
   the productions stage which contributed 7.9\%. The plant provides
   environmental, social and economic gains for the community, for
   instance, increased income for the associates and fishermen,
   environmental education in schools, and cooking oil recycling
   opportunities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of construction waste prevention: A case study
   in a social housing project in Southeast Brazil},
Journal = {CLEANER WASTE SYSTEMS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {This study analyzed construction waste prevention measures applied to a
   social housing project, with life cycle assessment (LCA), by three
   scenarios: base case scenario (BCS) - a single family house built with
   masonry blocks; prevention scenario 1 (PS1) - BCS assuming a theoretical
   optimization in materials consumption; prevention scenario 2 (PS2) - a
   house built with cast-in-situ concrete walls. The prevention scenarios
   showed waste reductions of 4\% (PS1) and 36\% (PS2). The environmental
   impacts have been evaluated by using CML baseline v.3.05; the impact
   categories were selected according to the EN 15.978:2011: global warming
   potential (GWP), acidification (AP), eutrophication (EP), ozone layer
   depletion (ODP), photochemical ozone formation (POF), abiotic depletion
   (AD), and abiotic depletion - fossil fuels (ADF). The PS1 reduced
   environmental impacts by 5\% whereas PS2 increased by 15\%, compared
   with BCS. The most critical construction steps for BCS and PS1 were
   coating and superstructure, whereas for PS2 were superstructure and
   painting. The materials extraction and production stage represent about
   90\% of the total impacts. The most critical materials for BCS and PS1
   were concrete, cement, and steel, whereas for PS2 those were concrete,
   steel, and paint. The most relevant categories for the three scenarios
   analyzed were GWP, ADF, and AP. The waste management stage was
   irrelevant in generating impacts, contributing for less than 1\% of the
   total impacts. These results highlight that despite reducing waste
   generation, prevention does not necessarily reduce the overall impacts
   of the edification, and therefore, the materials and construction
   methods used are especially relevant.},

Title = {Economic and greenhouse gas assessments for two hot water industrial
   systems: Solar vs. natural gas},
Journal = {CLEANER ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Recognizing the energy-intensive character of the industrial sector,
   especially for process heat, this study designs two hot water systems
   for a textile industry located in Northeast Brazil. Then both systems
   are compared from financial and environmental viewpoints. The economic
   analysis uses the Payback period, Internal Rate of Return, and Net
   Present Value. The environmental analysis uses the Life Cycle Assessment
   methodology to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions associated with
   building and operating both systems. The economic analysis confirms that
   the solar water heating system is viable, with a profitability rate of
   29.46, which makes it an attractive investment. The accountancy of
   greenhouse gases confirmed the potential of the solar system to mitigate
   climate change, with overall annual emissions 50 times lower than the
   natural gas system. The results obtained are highly related to
   sustainable development and cleaner production, and can be employed by
   decision makers aiming to change consumption and production patterns
   towards a more sustainable future.},

Title = {Energy efficiency strategies for Brazilian social housing considering a
   life cycle perspective: Optimisation between thermal autonomy, energy
   consumption and costs},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {295},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {This study aims to establish optimal cases for energy-efficient social
   housing projects in Brazil, considering a life cycle cost-benefit
   analysis. Energy efficiency measures for the building envelope were
   evaluated in representative single-family and multifamily typology
   projects for the lower-income sector, considering thermal autonomy,
   energy consumption and cost indicators. The measures estimated in terms
   of macrocomponents allowed for comparative evaluation and association
   with costs. Cases were simulated in EnergyPlus to obtain the building's
   expected operational consumption. With the macrocomponents and
   simulation data, Python routines were used to compute results for each
   proposed combination. Optimal cases that present high thermal
   performance in the national standard (NBR 15575) with
   cost-effectiveness, offering guidelines for projects in the 8 Brazilian
   bioclimatic zones, were established. Results presented in more detail
   for bioclimatic zone 8 showed optimal cases, with the increase in the
   percentage of hours of thermal autonomy reaching 65\%-71\%, whereas that
   of a typical building was 30\%, while life cycle cost related to the
   envelope showed reductions of up to 22\%, even with higher initial
   costs. This study served as a basis for the new Brazilian policy
   proposed by the National Housing Office (SNH) to develop new social
   housing projects.},

Title = {Constructive systems for social housing deployment in developing
   countries: A case study using dynamic life cycle carbon assessment and
   cost analysis in Brazil},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {227},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Developing economies struggle with both dealing with a housing shortage
   and reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. Appropriate constructive
   systems can play a role in satisfying thermal comfort and providing
   least cost solutions. In Brazil, an innovative constructive system -
   precast reinforced concrete panel (RCP) - has been increasingly used to
   raise productivity during the building construction stage. This study
   aims to assess existing trade-offs between the RCP and the conventional
   constructive system - ceramic block masonry (CBM) - in social housing
   deployment. Dynamic Life Cycle Carbon Assessment (cradle-to-grave), cost
   analysis and building thermal-energy simulations are applied in a case
   study for 6 Brazilian bioclimatic zones. The main findings show that the
   RCP has lower upfront costs, but worse performance in terms of GHG
   emissions and total cost (operational costs included), leading to a
   trade-off between social housing deployment and GHG emissions
   mitigation. This study provides insights for policy makers concerned
   with GHG emissions mitigation in the social housing sector, especially
   those from developing countries, where housing demand deficit is a
   relevant issue. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Poultry farming is often associated with negative environmental impacts,
   such as water quality degradation and greenhouse gas emissions. This
   study covers important gaps in the geographic scope of poultry farming
   using Life Cycle Assessment analysis. Data on animal feed, energy,
   packaging, and waste were collected from the poultry industry in
   Rondonia, Brazil. The life cycle inventory included all inflows and
   outflows of feed production, poultry housing, slaughter, processing, the
   retail market, and the functional unit of ``1 kg chicken meat with 0.22
   kg protein{''}. The ReCiPe Midpoint (H) method was used for seven
   categories of impact. The results showed that emissions of greenhouse
   gases (GHG, CO2, N2O and CH4) during the feed production phase was
   dominant, totaling 2.0 kg CO2-eq per kg of live weight produced. This
   stage was most relevant in six of seven categories of impacts assessed.
   During the poultry housing stage, terrestrial acidification was
   dominated by emissions of NH3, P and N2O from one-day-old chicks
   (hatching eggs, poultry house litter, and feed). The total environmental
   impact of producing broilers in Brazil amounted to 3.37 kg CO2-eq per kg
   of meat at the consumer market gate. The LPG gas and biological waste
   from slaughterhouses was dominant in this phase. The retail stage
   revealed contributions above 43\% in all impact categories due to high
   consumption of electricity (0.11 kWh (0.39 MJ) per kg of meat). Three
   scenarios were proposed and demonstrated, using biological residues as a
   source of nutrients for feed composition. The results showed that using
   poultry viscera meal led to better environmental outcomes for all
   impacted categories.},

Abstract = {Construction and demolition waste generation have increased
   significantly over the century, many times, as a result of obsolete
   buildings that lead the effort toward demolition. This paper
   investigates the environmental performance of mortars developed with
   recycled concrete from the partial building demolition of the Clementino
   Fraga Filho University Hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Life Cycle
   Assessment is associated with experimental data to validate the
   application of the residue as an alternative to cement-based mortars.
   Natural river sand and recycled concrete aggregates, both at a
   micrometer scale, are employed in the production of four different
   mortars of compressive strength ranging 50 MPa. The aggregates'
   replacement rates defined are 15, 25, and 50\% in volume. The recycled
   microparticles' mineralogical composition was determined by SEM images
   and XRD analysis. In addition, the attached cement paste surrounding the
   original aggregate particle was quantified by chemical attack.
   Rheological and mechanical properties of the resulting mortars were
   assessed by the Vane spindle rheometer and uniaxial compressive strength
   experiments, respectively. The approach to mortars' environmental
   performance considered a cradle-to-gate scope using different
   sensitivity analysis parameters. We demonstrated the feasibility of
   developing an eco-efficient mortar taking advantage of rarely applied
   recycled particles. Compressive strength and environmental performance
   (particularly, the ozone layer depletion potential and abiotic resource
   depletion potential categories) increased with the aggregate replacement
   rate. In addition, the rheological results provided relevant data, still
   insufficient to recycled aggregate mortars, presenting an exponential
   increase of yield stress with effective water to cement ratio.},

Abstract = {The Brazilian building sector does not have an organized and reliable
   database of sustainability indicators based on LCA - life-cycle
   assessment - that would allow for a comprehensive sustainability
   assessment of buildings. The aim of this research is to propose
   requirements and parameters to assist designers in taking into account
   sustainable performance, with respect to ISO 21.921-1: 2011 concepts,
   when selecting a building technology, for those situations in which an
   organized LCA database does not exist. The proposal also exemplifies an
   application of the sustainability requirements using the compensatory
   techniques of multi-criteria decision analysis. In addition, the paper
   discusses the identification of the stage of the building project in
   which technological selection must be conducted. Recommendations are
   based on a literature review of concepts, frameworks, methods and
   requirements of sustainability and on the consideration of
   sustainability requirements in building projects.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper was to present the results of a life cycle
   cost analysis concerning the purchase and operation of a more efficient
   popular refrigerator model compared with a baseline design in Brazil.
   The summarized results may be useful for organizations working to
   promote sustainable energy development. This paper specifically focuses
   on refrigerators, since their energy consumption is predicted to
   constitute over 30\% of the total average domestic electricity bill in
   Brazilian households. If all new Brazilian refrigerators had an energy
   efficiency at the level consistent with the least life cycle cost of
   ownership, it would result in an annual savings of 2.8 billion dollars
   (US\$) in electricity bills, 45 TWh of electricity demand, and 18 Mt of
   CO2 emissions, with a respective payback period of 7 years which is less
   than half the average estimated lifetime of a refrigerator. The analysis
   was conducted following the guidelines of similar analyses available
   from the US Department of Energy and the Collaborative Labeling and
   Appliance Standards Program.},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The objective of this study is to assess the environmental benefit of
   using rainwater, greywater, water efficient appliances and their
   combinations in low-income houses. The study was conducted surveying
   twenty households located in southern Brazil, which resulted in water
   end-uses estimation. Then, embodied energy, potential for potable water
   savings and sewage reduction when using the different strategies were
   estimated. The environmental benefit analysis of these strategies was
   performed using an indicator that includes embodied energy, potable
   water savings, reduction of sewage and energy consumption in the water
   utility, and sewage production during the life cycle of the system. The
   results indicated that the strategy with the greatest environmental
   benefit is the use of water-efficient appliances, which resulted in
   substantial water savings and reduction of sewage, causing low
   environmental impact due to lower embodied energy over the life cycle.

Abstract = {The construction sector has a meaningful contribution to the global
   scarcity of natural resources, as well as to impacts on the natural
   environment Most life cycle assessments have focused on impacts
   associated with the energy efficiency of buildings, in particular during
   the operational phase. However, the construction phase of buildings
   accounts for a significant share of a building's embodied energy and is
   responsible for impacts related to resource depletion. With the aim to
   contribute to more all-embracing assessments in the construction sector,
   this study aims to compare three different wall types commonly used in
   Brazil, according to their environmental performances: ceramic brick,
   concrete brick and cast-in place reinforced concrete exterior walls. The
   results were analyzed with the software SimaPro 7.3 and with the life
   cycle impact assessment method IMPACT 2002+ (version Q2.2). Ceramic
   brick walls have less impact than the concrete brick and the
   cast-in-place reinforced concrete exterior walls on three different
   endpoint indicators (Climate Change, Resource Depletion and Water
   Withdrawal). The results were not significant regarding impacts on Human
   Health and Ecosystem, Quality. Different sensitivity analyses were
   carried out in order to test the final results, as well as uncertainty
   analysis, related to the variability of inventory data and the
   characterization of the life cycle inventory results into midpoints
   and/or endpoints. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Ceramic bricks are one of the most widely used materials in both
   commercial and residential buildings. Ceramic bricks play a relevant
   role in the Brazilian economy. The basic input material for this
   industry is red clay. As environmental problems increase, the need for
   environment-friendly building design increases. To achieve this,
   architects and engineers need reliable data on the environmental impacts
   of various building materials, including ceramic bricks. In this paper a
   comparative Life Cycle Assessment between two ceramic brick production
   units in Santa Catarina State, Brazil, has been carried in a comparative
   approach. Key impact categories, including fossil fuel use, global
   warming, ozone depletion, ecotoxicity, and human toxicity were assessed.
   The analysis has shown a particular relevance of the respiratory effects
   in both systems and the critical point has been found in the fuel used
   in the furnace for firing the bricks which are responsible, during the
   firing process, for the relevant CO2 emissions.},

Title = {Adressing Energy Demand and Climate Change through the Second Law of
   Thermodynamics and LCA towards a Rational Use of Energy in Brazilian
   Households},

Abstract = {This study focuses on a typical Brazilian household through the lens of
   sustainable development, regarding energy demand and GHG emissions. The
   analysis encompasses both the direct and indirect energy, exergy
   consumption, and GHG emissions (quantified by life cycle assessment)
   associated with the usual routine of a household. The household is
   modeled as a thermodynamic system to evaluate inputs (food, electricity,
   fuels for transportation) and outputs (solid and liquid residues). The
   hypothesis is that each input and output contains CO2,eq emissions and
   exergy derived from its physical-chemical characteristics or production
   chains. Each household appliance is modeled and tested as a function of
   external parameters. The contribution of several industries was obtained
   to the total GHG emissions and exergy flows entering and exiting the
   household (e.g., fuels for transportation, food, gas, electricity,
   wastewater treatment, solid waste). It was verified that urban
   transportation was the flow with the highest GHG and exergy intensity,
   ranging between 1.49 and 7.53 kgCO(2,eq)/day and achieving 94.7 MJ/day,
   almost five times higher than the calculated exergy demand due to
   electricity. The second largest flow in GHG emissions was food due to
   the characteristics of the production chains, ranging from 1.6 to 4.75
   kgCO(2,eq)/day, depending on the adopted diet. On the other hand, the
   electricity presented low GHG emissions due to the main energy sources
   used to generate electricity, only 0.52 kgCO(2,eq)/day. Moreover, the
   chemical exergy of the solid waste was 9.7 MJ/day, and is not irrelevant
   compared to the other flows, representing an interesting improvement
   opportunity as it is entirely wasted in the baseline scenario.},

Title = {Challenges and political implications of sustainable maintenance in

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {380},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study investigated the challenges and political implications of
   sustainable maintenance in residential condominiums in Brazil from the
   perspective of the building life cycle. The research adopted a
   mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods.
   Structured questionnaires were administered to 94 participants, selected
   based on accessibility and interest in the topic, along with participant
   observation in a condominium certified by the AQUA-HQETM Process and
   document analysis. Statistical analysis included descriptive measures,
   Bartlett's test of sphericity, and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index, which,
   together with exploratory factor analysis, identified five factors that
   explain 45.2 \% of the total variance in the data, highlighting the
   relevance of key variables related to perceptions of sustainability,
   incentives, and challenges in maintenance. The results reveal a low
   awareness among owners' residents about the importance of sustainable
   maintenance, difficulties in the transfer of information between
   construction companies and managers, and the insufficiency of effective
   public incentives. Thus, the study highlights a gap in the integrated
   application of Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment in the construction
   sector, suggesting the need to develop more robust public policies and
   establish quantitative indicators to measure the economic and
   environmental benefits of these practices. In summary, the findings
   contribute to understanding the barriers and opportunities in promoting
   sustainable practices in buildings, emphasizing the importance of
   interventions that articulate technical, economic, and social aspects to
   enhance condominium management and foster more sustainable urban
   development.},

Abstract = {Ornithodoros mimon Kohls et al. is an argasid tick, originally described
   from larvae collected on bats from Bolivia and Uruguay. In Brazil the
   species is aggressive to humans and animals. Nymphs and adults of O.
   mimon were collected from the roof of a residence in Araraquara, So
   Paulo, Brazil, whose residents were bitten by ticks. Once in the
   laboratory, they were fed on rabbits and maintained in biological oxygen
   demand incubator at 27 +/- 1 A degrees C and 90 +/- 10 \% relative
   humidity. The females, after mating, laid eggs that resulted in larvae
   that were identified by the original description and also by the
   paratypes examination (RML 50271-50274) deposited at the United State
   National Tick Collection, Georgia, GA, USA. The life cycle of this
   species was obtained through the acquisition of two generations of ticks
   (F1 and F2) in the laboratory using rodents and rabbits as hosts. The
   biological parameters of larva, nymph and adult stages of both
   generations were recorded from infestations of the laboratory hosts.
   Larvae showed a profile of feeding for days on the host, whereas the
   nymphs and adults fed only for few minutes. First nymphal instar (N1)
   molted to second nymphal instar (N2) without blood meal. The species
   life cycle was elucidated for the first time.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses procedures for the production of software for the
   commercial marketplace. Instead of working from a software He-cycle
   model, a life-cycle ``mold{''} is used. The mold provides points and
   guidelines that are considered ``basic{''} for a successful production
   process. A software-house can build its own model by adding details and
   specific characteristics (of the development team, target market and
   product) to the mold. The resulting model is more realistic (hence the
   name R-Cycle) and reflects operating dynamics of the development,
   Marketing, sales and support processes. Emphasis is given to topics that
   are only discussed superficially by the bibliography on Software
   Engineering practices: Marketing (instrumental to product definition and
   evolution), preparation (which includes product documentation) and
   making the product available for sale (managing the sale effort and
   providing post-sale support). The contents of the paper summarize
   results of the R-Cycle Project sponsored by the Brazilian Research and
   Development Council for Science and Technology (CNPq) through its
   ProTem-CC Program (Grant 481.283/94-3) and could assist the management
   of a software production enterprise. As such they have already been
   adopted by companies associated with Softex, CNPq's program to promote
   software export, and could complement reading material in Software
   Engineering courses.},

Title = {Life cycle energy assessment and economic feasibility of stormwater
   harvested from pervious pavements},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {170},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Pervious pavements are one of the most used construction techniques
   among the Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS). The objective of
   this article is to analyse the energy life cycle and the life cycle cost
   of stormwater harvesting systems using pervious pavements models in
   order to compare and evaluate the differences and verify what influences
   the profitability and sustainability. The method proposed started with
   the definition of pervious pavement models based on literature review.
   The main characteristic of the models analysed was the use of porous
   asphalt with different underlying layers, i.e. thickness and material.
   The hydrological-hydraulic design of the pavements was also assessed.
   The potential for potable water savings due to harvesting stormwater
   from a parking lot was estimated for a public building in Florianopolis,
   southern Brazil. The models were compared to identify what most
   influences the potable water savings, the profitability and the
   sustainability of the systems. The maximum potable water savings found
   were 42\%. It was also observed that the overall consumption of the
   building has been decreasing over the years, and the yearly rainfall has
   increased, which leads to a higher potential. In the current water
   consumption pattern, none of the systems evaluated was profitable or
   presented sustainability, evaluated herein as negative energy balance.
   However, it was verified that if analysed comparatively with
   non-pervious pavement, it was profitable to use stormwater harvested
   from the pervious pavement. Thus, it can be concluded that stormwater
   harvesting systems in combination with pervious pavements are promising,
   serving as SUDS and saving money for users. It is also noticeable that
   the use of porous asphalt is not recommended when aiming for systems
   with low embedded energy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The consumption of poultry meat as a source of animal protein has been
   increasing worldwide, especially in emerging countries' economies. Due
   to the growing demand for this protein, we seek to evaluate the
   eco-efficiency of poultry production systems, namely positive pressure,
   dark house, and organic systems, in the South region of Brazil. To
   achieve the proposed objective, two methods were used: life cycle
   assessment and economic value added, considering the functional unit of
   one kg of live chicken ready for slaughter, specifically from the cradle
   to farm gate. The results show that most of the environmental impacts
   are from the production of grains for the manufacture of animal feed
   and, consequently, from the electric energy consumed by the equipment of
   the aviaries. Conventional systems show negative results for economic
   value added/kg, evidencing the destruction of the producers' economic
   value, that is, the capital invested is not remunerated proportionally
   to the risk assumed in the activity, with environmental impacts similar
   as dark house systems. Poultry produced in organic systems showed the
   best economic performance (economic value added/kg). However, they cause
   a slightly greater environmental impact than other systems. In order to
   minimize uncertainties regarding the results obtained, a sensitivity
   analysis and Monte Carlo simulation were performed, identifying net
   operating revenue and invested capital as the variables with the
   greatest and least impacts on the value of economic value added/kg in
   all types of production systems analyzed. (c) 2020 Institution of

Title = {Life cycle integrated multi-criteria decision model for roof assessment},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {336},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Roofs significantly impact urban microclimates and indoor environments.
   However, selecting a suitable roof typology is complex due to
   environmental, social, and economic issues. This study aims to propose a
   method that comprises four parameters to support the selection of the
   most sustainable roof typology: life cycle energy assessment, urban heat
   island, life cycle cost analysis and thermal comfort. A top-floor flat
   in a multifamily residential building model with conventional (fibre
   cement), cool and green roofs, with and without thermal insulation, was
   used as a case study. The Brazilian climatic contexts of Florianopolis,
   Curitiba, and Brasilia were considered. Computer simulations on
   EnergyPlus and data from the literature, technical specifications, a
   Brazilian database for quantifying materials and services and market
   prices were used to assess the roof typologies' performance in each
   parameter. A questionnaire was applied to a panel of building experts to
   define the relative importance of each parameter. A multi-criteria
   decision-making (MCDM) method combining Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)
   and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution
   (TOPSIS) was used to weigh the parameters and select the most
   energy-sustainable roof alternative for each climatic context. The cool
   roof was the most sustainable in Florianopolis and Brasilia, whereas the
   green roof was in Curitiba. Conventional roofs performed worst in all
   cities due to lower environmental and social efficiency. The method
   proposed herein offers valuable guidance for selecting
   energy-sustainable roofs and urban planning strategies, with
   adaptability to other roof typologies and countries, enabling tailored
   roof solutions for local conditions.},

Title = {Analyzing Diets' Contribution to Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Brasilia,
   Brazil},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Given the effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, understanding
   the consumption patterns that facilitate and support changes is
   essential. In this context, household food consumption constitutes a
   large part of society's environmental impacts due to the production and
   solid waste generation stages. Hence, we focus on applying the Life
   Cycle Assessment to estimate Brasilia's GHG emissions associated with
   household food consumption. We have used microdata from the Personal
   Food Consumption Analysis to address consumption patterns. The life
   cycle approach relies on the adaptations for Brasilia's scenario of the
   inventories available in the databases of Ecoinvent 3.6 Cutoff and
   Agribalyse 3.0.1. Individuals' GHG emissions results were classified
   according to sociodemographic groups and dietary patterns and analyzed
   through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results indicate that
   household food consumption contributes 11,062.39 t CO(2)e daily,
   averaging 5.05 kg CO(2)e per capita. Meat consumption accounts for the
   largest share of emissions (55.27\%), followed by beverages (18.78\%)
   and cereals (7.29\%). The ANOVA results indicate that individuals living
   in houses, individuals between 45 and 54 years old, and men have a
   higher carbon footprint. Therefore, future analyses for potential
   reduction should incorporate these target groups. Regarding dietary
   patterns, vegan individuals contribute 3.05 kg CO(2)e/day, 59.00\% fewer
   emissions than omnivorous people. The no red meat, pescatarian, and
   vegetarian diets also imply lower food-related GHG emissions.},

Title = {Targeting Energy Efficiency through Air Conditioning Operational Modes

   and Thermal Energy Storage. Case Study Brazil},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Economy and parsimony in the consumption of energy resources are
   becoming a part of common sense in practically all countries, although
   the effective implementation of energy efficiency policies still has a
   long way to go. The energy demand for residential buildings is one of
   the most significant energy sinks. We focus our analysis on one of the
   most energy-consuming systems of residential buildings located in
   regions of tropical climate, which are cooling systems. We evaluate to
   which degree the integration of thermal energy storage (TES) and
   photovoltaic (PV) systems helps to approach an annual net zero energy
   building (NZEB) configuration, aiming to find a feasible solution in the
   direction of energy efficiency in buildings. To conduct the simulations,
   an Energy Efficiency Analysis Framework (EEAF) is proposed. A literature
   review unveiled a potential knowledge gap about the optimization of the
   ASHRAE operational modes (full storage load, load leveled, and demand
   limiting) for air conditioning/TES sets using PV connected to the grid.
   A hypothetical building was configured with detailed loads and
   occupation profiles to simulate different configurations of air
   conditioning associated with TES and a PV array. Using TRNSYS software,
   a set of scenarios was simulated, and their outputs are analyzed in a
   life cycle perspective using life cycle costing (LCC). The modeling and
   simulation of different scenarios allowed for identifying the most
   economic configurations from a life cycle perspective, within a safe
   range of operability considering the energy efficiency and consequently
   the sustainability aspects of the buildings. The EEAF also supports
   other profiles, such as those in which the occupancy of residential
   buildings during the day is increased due to significant changes in
   people's habits, when working and studying in home office mode, for
   example. These changes in habits should bring a growing interest in the
   adoption of solar energy for real-time use in residential buildings. The
   results can be used as premises for the initial design or planning
   retrofits of buildings, aiming at the annual net zero energy balance.},

Abstract = {We assess and compare energy intensities in different setups of

   reservoir volumes. The contribution of each component to the energy
   intensity was considered, as well the feedstock energy of the materials
   in final waste disposal. None of the evaluated systems were able to meet
   the total demand for water in a household due production limitations
   such as catchment area and precipitation. In all RWHS evaluated, the
   energy intensity was lower than municipality. Larger catchment areas
   increase productivity and reduce the energy intensity of the systems.
   Differently, increasing reservoir volume initially reduces energy
   intensity and reaches an optimal point around 1000-2500 L capacity. The
   construction phase had more intensity than the use phase.},

   to be consistent with micro and macro data from Brazil. Our analysis
   reveals that, despite a decrease in voluntary savings, the policy
   expands aggregate savings, output, and wages, leading to long-run
   welfare gains. We show that although better risk sharing is important
   for our findings, the bulk of the gains come from improved efficiency as
   labor productivity increases and labor supply is reallocated towards
   highly educated workers and the early stages of the life cycle where
   agents are generally poorer and leisure is less valued. Interestingly,
   most of the gains we find accrue to less educated agents as the
   distribution of this group is skewed towards the informal sector, and
   they do not directly incur the additional burden from the increase in
   contributions. We also explore an alternative policy design in which
   households are allowed to access their severance savings accounts only
   after retirement, as in a defined contribution pension system. We find
   that despite greater uncertainty in medical costs later in life,
   households prefer a more flexible system that provides access to the SSA
   fund during working-age and after retirement.},

Title = {Environmental performance of agroforestry systems in the Cerrado biome,
   Brazil},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {122},
Pages = {339-348},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Agriculture and land use practices must be significantly improved to
   satisfy the needs of future generations without placing further pressure
   on global ecosystems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) have been quoted as one
   of the best options to mitigate environmental impacts and at the same
   time, improve smallholders' livelihoods in agricultural areas. However,
   studies investigating the environmental aspects and yield of
   agroforestry systems in rural settlements, established by governmental
   initiatives, are still uncommon in the literature. Therefore, the goal
   of this paper was to assess the contribution of five bio-diverse AFS,
   located in the Cerrado biome, to global warming mitigation and the
   provision of ecosystem services to smallholder farmers. Additionally,
   the importance of agroforestry projects to family farms in Brazil was
   discussed. Relying on data from forestry inventory and in-depth
   interviews with farmers, the crop yield (including fruit) was estimated;
   and the life cycle assessment method was used to determine the Global
   Warming Potential (GWP), accounting for all emissions to establish and
   manage the AFS up until the date of analysis. The results show the
   significant capacity of AFS sequester carbon, represented by the
   negative values of GWP, ranging from (-263) to (-496) t CO2 equivalents
   per hectare. Each farmer adopted different tree and crop species at the
   AFS establishment what influenced yields and GWP. The high number of
   fruit trees contributed positively to the AFS outputs, allowing farmers
   to consume and sell a large variety of products. Furthermore, the
   households also benefit from microclimate and aesthetic benefits
   provided by the AFS5. Future agroforestry projects in rural settlements
   can contribute significantly to improve household livelihoods, as well
   as environmental protection. However, efforts should be taken to provide
   farmers with sound knowledge, financial support, and access to markets
   to thrive. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Implementing ecological intensification in fish farming: definition and

Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Ecological intensification is a new concept in agriculture that
   addresses the double challenge of maintaining a level of production
   sufficient to support needs of human populations and respecting the
   environment in order to conserve the natural world and human quality of
   life. This article adapts this concept to fish farming using
   agroecological principles and the ecosystem services framework. The
   method was developed from the study of published literature and
   applications at four study sites chosen for their differences in
   production intensity: polyculture ponds in France, integrated pig and
   pond polyculture in Brazil, the culture of striped catfish in Indonesia
   and a recirculating salmon aquaculture system in France. The study of
   stakeholders' perceptions of ecosystem services combined with
   environmental assessment through Life Cycle Assessment and Emergy
   accounting allowed development of an assessment tool that was used as a
   basis for co-building evolution scenarios. From this experience,
   ecological intensification of aquaculture was defined as the use of
   ecological processes and functions to increase productivity, strengthen
   ecosystem services and decrease disservices. It is based on
   aquaecosystem and biodiversity management and the use of local and
   traditional knowledge. Expected consequences for farming systems consist
   of greater autonomy, efficiency and better integration into their
   surrounding territories. Ecological intensification requires territorial
   governance and helps improve it from a sustainable development
   perspective.},

Abstract = {Cleaning products changed the relation between humans and the

   the world which increases these products' assessment relevance. Its
   inappropriate use impacts, negatively, in the environment and human
   health problems. The Eco-efficiency assessment is a tool to identify the
   life cycle hotspots and to propose technically feasible improvements.
   This study was done based in the NBR ISO 14045:2014 for three detergents
   produced in Teresina-Piaui-Brazil, namely products A, B and C. Primary
   and secondary data regarding inputs, outputs and selling prices were
   collected from three different manufacturers, the Ecoinvent database and
   patents. The selling price was the product system value indicator. The
   results were related in an Eco-efficiency matrix. The assessed products
   had high environmental impacts in the categories of acidification,
   eutrophication, scarcity of fossil and mineral resources and water use.
   The use stage had the greatest impacts within the referred categories
   due to water consumption and wastewater treatment. For the product
   system value, detergents A and C had a lower selling prices than product
   B. All detergents had high environmental impacts, then the product
   system value was decisive for them to occupy the matrix quadrants' three
   or four. Detergent C was the best choice among the three products due to
   its lower environmental impacts in the selected categories and selling
   price. Through the sensitivity analysis, it was proposed environmentally
   viable changes in the product's critical points, as changes in the
   product formula, for manufacturers, and water consumption reduction
   equipment, for users.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {908},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The environmental assessment of urban water systems through life cycle
   analysis can be facilitated by using a modular approach. This study
   aimed to use such an approach to assess the impact of implementing
   rainwater harvesting systems in buildings in the urban environment
   during their lifespan, from manufacture to disposal. For this purpose,
   urban systems were divided into components (water treatment plant,
   potable water distribution, consumer water use, wastewater collection
   and wastewater treatment plant). The impacts were quantified using the
   ReCiPe 2016 H impact assessment method, which considers eighteen impact
   categories. A case study was carried out in the Bele ` m river basin in
   central Curitiba, southern Brazil, to validate the method. The results
   showed a reduction of environmental impacts of up to 23.0 \% on water
   treatment plants, up to 19.0 \% on potable water distribution and up to
   11.3 \% on wastewater treatment plants with the implementation of
   rainwater harvesting systems. The consumer component was the most
   significant contributor in eight and seven impact categories in the
   scenarios with and without rainwater harvesting, respectively. Despite
   the increased infrastructure materials, the results showed potential for
   environmental impact reduction with rainwater harvesting, mainly in
   urban water systems' operation process (energy and chemicals
   consumption). By analysing the total impacts, implementing rainwater
   harvesting reduced the impacts in eleven out of eighteen impact
   categories analysed (up to 11.0 \% reduction). The principal reductions
   occurred in ozone depletion, ionising radiation and water use. Finally,
   the modular life cycle assessment approach proved to be a comprehensive
   analysis, which can aid in the analysis and decision-making for
   different scenarios.},

Abstract = {The definition of simple and reliable emission baselines is crucial to
   foster clean development mechanism (CDM) projects. This paper assesses a
   project methodology that could boost large-scale energy-efficiency
   projects in the sector of domestic appliances. The baseline appliance is
   defined a priori in a ``conservative{''} manner as the design option
   minimizing life-cycle social costs. The project methodology consists in
   a program which rebates new appliances according to their emission
   savings compared to the baseline. Is the proposed baseline acceptable?
   What could be the impact of such project on emissions? To address these
   questions, we look for insights from a hypothetical case on Brazilian
   refrigerators. A rational choice model is developed which assumes that
   households select design options minimizing life-cycle private costs.
   Results suggest that electricity tariff distortions and financial
   constraints might hamper project performances and allow significant
   free-riding. Low income households remain trapped into low-efficiency
   choices and high income households adopt outperforming appliances,
   whether rebated or not. However, simple solutions likely to improve the
   project methodology do exist. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Environmental and carbon footprint of tourist accommodation: A
   comparative study of popular hotel categories in Brazil and Peru},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {328},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The environmental externalities of tourist accommodation are
   substantial, but their scientific appraisals have been far from
   holistic. Existing environmental impact assessment studies focus on
   hotel operations and exclude indirect material inputs and outputs due to
   data (un)availability. Important environmental `hotspots' can be ignored
   in the result as these are often concealed in the diversity and
   complexity of a hotel's products and services. This study employs the
   method of environmental life cycle impact assessment to appraise the
   environmental externalities occurring through the life cycle of four
   popular comfort categories of hotels (hostel, budget, upmarket and
   luxury) in two countries of South America (Brazil and Peru). The
   appraisal is facilitated by the ecoinvent database (version 3.6,
   Allocation cut-off by classification) and the SimaPro software (version
   9.1.1). The intra-sectoral and cross-country analysis reveals
   correlation of the environmental and carbon footprint with hotel comfort
   categories. The study finds that (1) treatment of solid waste generated
   in hotel operations; (2) construction of the hotel building; and (3)
   operational energy use; generate the largest footprints across all major
   impact categories. The contribution of (4) consumer goods, such as
   furniture, electric and electronic equipment, bathroom/sanitary fixtures
   and carpets, is also significant. The study advocates that these
   operational and non-operational material inputs and outputs should be
   accounted for in future environmental and carbon impact assessments of
   hotels. The study provides the first benchmarks of major embodied,
   indirect environmental and carbon impacts of hotels that can be used,
   with appropriate adjustments, in future research.},

Abstract = {The stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) and horn fly (Haematobia irritans)
   are mainly parasites of cattle that spend the early phase of their life
   cycle in decaying vegetation, manure and soil, as members of a wide
   range of other harmful and beneficial arthropods. Predators of the
   family Macrochelidae are considered beneficial mites that have been
   considered promising biological control agents of fly eggs and larvae
   and of other harmful organisms. The objectives of this study were: a) to
   compare the predation and oviposition rates of three Macrocheles
   species, M. embersoni, M. muscaedomesticae and M. robustulus, on six
   prey species: S. calcitrans, Musca domestica , H. irritans, Bradysia
   matogrossensis, Rhizoglyphus echinopus and the free living nematode
   Rhabditella axei; b) to evaluate the life cycle of the best performing
   predator (M. embersoni) on the most suitable prey species at 30 +/- 2
   degrees C, 95 +/- 5\% RH and in the dark. The three macrochelid species
   consumed all evaluated prey species, but M. embersoni had higher
   predation and daily oviposition rates on larvae of S. calcitrans (23.8
   larvae consumed and laid about 4.0 eggs, respectively) than other
   species. Total immature development of M. embersoni was completed in at
   most about 1.3 days on eggs of S. calcitrans and M. domestica and 1.5
   days on R. axei. Macrocheles embersoni produced most eggs (0.28-0.34
   female/female/day; r(m): 0.28-0.34) on those same prey. The results of
   this study suggest that M. embersoni is a promising biological control
   agent of S. calcitrans and M. domestica.},

Title = {Water Balance Modeling as a Tool for Assessing the Inventory Flows of
   Urban Water Systems and Water Consumption in Buildings},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCES PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {151},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {A water balance modeling method was developed and applied to assess the
   water flow impact on urban water systems and water consumption in
   buildings. The method is based on the computational tool Aquacycle and a
   case study applied in a city in Brazil. Some modifications have been
   made to Aquacycle, including using urban drainage and sewage structures
   commonly applied in Brazil and parameters closer to the Brazilian
   reality. Such structures are decentralized wastewater treatment systems,
   deep tubular wells, irregular urban networks, and covered tanks for
   storing rainwater. Also, an automatic rainwater harvesting system was
   considered for flood mitigation. The water balance proposed may also be
   used for a modular assessment approach in urban water systems, aiming to
   facilitate the application of life-cycle assessment. A case study also
   aimed to assess alternative water supply in buildings, including
   scenarios with and without rainwater harvesting. The most significant
   positive impacts of using rainwater in buildings were a decrease of
   almost 6\% in stormwater runoff and a decrease of water consumption by
   around 30\%. There is a substantial waste of water in the distribution
   process, which, although it favors groundwater recharge, can have a high
   impact when considering energy and chemical products consumption. All
   contributions obtained via modeling can be used to provide specific
   fluxes in each component that can be used for technical, financial, or
   environmental evaluations, such as life-cycle approaches, carbon
   footprint, and cost-benefit assessment.},

Title = {Fair wage potential as a tool for social assessment in building projects},
Journal = {ENGINEERING CONSTRUCTION AND ARCHITECTURAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {28},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1295-1318},
Month = {APR 28},
Abstract = {Purpose The fair wage potential (FWP) is a social assessment method that
   can serve as an important measure to estimate the related social impacts
   along a product's life cycle; however, it does not admit a direct
   relation to the functional unit. This research presents the weighted
   fair wage potential (WFWP) method that relates the functional unit to
   the FWP. It is a simplified method to connect the material inventory to
   social data. This study aims to develop an approach to assess and choose
   the best construction typology for buildings based on the social
   sustainability of workers involved in the sectors.
   Design/methodology/approach The study is presented in phases. Phase 1
   selected and identified two Brazilian house projects, which were
   considered for the following processes: extraction of raw materials,
   manufacture of building materials and housing construction. Phase 2
   assembled the social life cycle inventories and executed them using the
   social life cycle assessment (SLCA). The inventory of materials followed
   the functional unit: ``1.0 m(2) of the built housing{''}, and the social
   inventory observed data extracted from the National Household Sample
   Survey (PNAD). The study considered the stakeholder category
   ``worker{''} and analysed the impact subcategory ``fair salary{''}. The
   study also divided the social data into categories: worker gender,
   worker race/colour, worker union and worker formality to analyse the
   impact of subcategories: ``equal opportunities/discrimination{''},
   ``freedom of association and collective bargaining{''} and ``social
   benefits/social security{''}. Phase 3 compared the projects according to
   the results from the SLCA. The FWP considers the wage paid at supply
   chain sectors, and the WFWP relates the functional unit to the social
   data. Findings The results proved that the wages paid by the
   construction supply chain are fair. However, there are differences
   between the FWP of male and female workers, white and non-white workers,
   unionised and non-unionised workers and formal and informal workers. The
   study of the actual Brazilian minimum wage indicated that the FWP is
   sensitive to the reference wage to which the analysed wages paid are
   related. Considering the WFWP, the constructive typology employed in
   Project B can generate increased positive social impacts than Project A.
   The proposed study provides excellent results, and it can be adapted to
   different data to assess the social conditions of other countries and
   sectors. Research limitations/implications There is not enough primary
   data available for the variables real wages and real working time; for
   this reason, these variables received secondary data. Another limitation
   is the data used for the year range, since Brazilian microdata do not
   include years before 2002 and years beyond 2015. Originality/value The
   WFWP differs from the existing social sustainability studies because it
   relates the material information to social data; also, it defines the
   best option among the analysed alternatives, taking into consideration
   social sustainability, which enables the project design to go beyond
   technical aspects. The constructive typology and materials take into
   account the social sustainability of the construction supply chain,
   generating more sustainable projects and improving the circumstances of
   affected stakeholders.},

Abstract = {Nests (n=60) of a solitary mud-daubing wasp, Brachymenes dyscherus were
   collected at Fazenda Santa Carlota, Cajuru, Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1995
   and 1996. The multi-celled mud nests were constructed on the interior
   walls of abandoned houses in dry and shaded places. Nests were composed
   of 1 to 4 layers with cells constructed in two parallel series. The
   number of cells per nest ranged from 3 to 62. Cells containing prey
   (larvae of Lepidoptera) numbered from 4 to 29. B. dyscherus is a
   univoltine species. Adults emerge from September to December, and
   nesting takes place at the beginning of the following year; however, the
   developmental period for some immatures with prolonged diapause lasted
   up to 596 days. The total duration of immature stages in nests collected
   in 1996 was less for males than for females. The sex ratio for the total
   population was 1.5 males: 1 female with males emerging earlier than
   females. A life table was constructed, and details of the life cycle of
   the wasps and parasitoids are presented. The most common mortality
   factors were either endogenous or due to Melittobia sp. (Eulophidae).},

Abstract = {Much has been discussed in the international literature about the
   relationship between family arrangements and migration decision-making,
   although few studies have done so through the analysis of quantitative
   data from migrants' countries of origin. Based on the theoretical
   contributions brought by the New Economics of Labor Migration and
   Transnationalism, we investigate how three intervening factors affect
   household living arrangements in the migrant's country of origin:
   people's life-cycle stages, migration regimes, and family normative
   systems. Using as case study the municipality of Governador Valadares,
   Brazil, the country's main international emigration hotspot, we draw on
   a mixed-methods approach that includes the analysis of the Brazilian
   Census and novel survey data, in addition to 20 in-depth semi-structured
   interviews with migrants' relatives and returnees. The results point to
   clear differences between the structure of households with and without
   international emigrants. The reasons for these differences may be
   two-fold: (a) international emigration is an important factor leading to
   the rearrangement of family care systems, and (b) migration
   decision-making processes are dependent upon particular household
   structures, family norms and migration regimes.},

Abstract = {We posit a life-cycle hypothesis for the evolving role of National
   Development Banks (NDBs) using the case of one of the largest such
   institutions in the world, the Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES). NDBs
   are a particularly important institution for channeling long-term credit
   in less developed financial markets. However, we argue that as countries
   develop their financial markets, NDBs should share this role with other
   local banks and specialize their focus, eventually disappearing
   altogether. In the Brazilian case, we show how the BNDES evolved from a
   purveyor of long-term credit to a more complex financial institution.
   The BNDES was the most important tool used by the Brazilian government
   as a countercyclical response to the financial crisis. For many
   developing countries, institutions like the BNDES may be a tenable
   solution for building long-term local financial institutions and
   markets, and developing specialized human capital. However, they also
   pose potential risks centered on issues of scalability, crowding out,
   graft and inefficiency. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Title = {Fuel-cell technologies for private vehicles in Brazil: Environmental
   mirage or prospective romance? A comparative life cycle assessment of
   PEMFC and SOFC light-duty vehicles},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {798},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Fuel cell vehicles (FCV) have been proclaimed as a zero-tailpipe
   emissions alternative for passenger transportation; however, their
   overall environmental performance must be evaluated on a per-case basis.
   Although the environmental impacts (EI) of FCV have been already
   described in the literature, there is no evidence of comprehensive life
   cycle assessment studies analyzing the Brazilian case and its unique
   features, such as, the availability of biogenic feedstocks for hydrogen
   production via steam reform, high share of renewables in the electricity
   mix and the a novel powertrain technology based on solid-oxide fuel
   cells (SOFC) which could run on bioethanol. The purpose of this study
   was to quantify the EIs of polymer-electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC)
   vehicles when hydrogen is produced in Brazilian conditions for a current
   and a 2030 scenario. Additionally, we intended to quantify the EIs of a
   prospective SOFC vehicle. Considering the significant burden of hydrogen
   production, we further aimed to explore several pathways and feedstocks
   for production. We found that SOFC vehicles could become a competitive
   alternative for impact mitigation in 2030. Most significant impact
   reductions are not likely to arise from fuel cell weight reduction as
   its burden is low compared to other car components or fuel production.
   As for today, PEMFC vehicles would not be competitive for any evaluated
   impact category. In fact, for global warming potential (GWP), they
   perform as bad as gasoline-fueled conventional vehicles. Assuming a
   centralized hydrogen production scheme, the distribution infrastructure
   was not a large contributor on a per-km basis. Nevertheless, building an
   entire hydrogen production and distribution infrastructure could be
   avoided under the SOFC powertrain technology. The environmental
   modelling of the SOFC was bound to uncertainties due to the lack of
   data. For GWP, the current ICEV ethanol car is competitive even for 2030
   technologies, assuming the land does not come from deforestation. (c)

Abstract = {The construction sector plays an important role in most economies;
   therefore, any waste reduction in a building's life cycle will result in
   a significant benefit to the economy. It is at the building design phase
   that most costs and wastes are defined for the entire building life
   cycle. Moreover, many forms of waste are also accumulated during the
   design phase itself. This article presents a new approach for organizing
   and managing the building design phase in a more effective and efficient
   way. This approach, called project cell, promotes concurrent engineering
   and lean management principles to achieve better performance during the
   design of a building. The project cell approach was implemented in the
   design process of a generic kindergarten project for the Brazilian
   Ministry of Education. In this case study, the implementation of project
   cell resulted in better productivity in the building design process as
   well as more effective building designs when compared with the
   traditional departmentalized approaches. The authors believe that
   introducing project cell may be valuable contribution to the
   Construction Engineering Management (CEM) body of knowledge. DOI:

Year = {2018},
Volume = {83},

Abstract = {Buildings' facades play an important role in the protection of buildings
   and, therefore, their envelope system must comply with its function,
   fulfilling the performance requirements and withstanding the external
   environmental agents during the buildings' life cycle. Although the
   degradation of buildings is a natural process, there are various factors
   that influence their durability. The assessment of the buildings'
   durability and service life is a research field that brings together
   several knowledge areas, e.g. construction technology, building physics
   and meteorology. This paper intends to identify the main factors that
   influence the durability of adhesive ceramic external wall claddings,
   developing models to predict their service life that involve these
   variables. The service life prediction models proposed in this study are
   defined based on simple and multiple regression analysis, both linear
   and nonlinear. The proposed models are defined based on the in situ
   evaluation of the degradation condition of 96 ceramic claddings of
   residential buildings in Brasilia. The methodology led to coherent
   results and its applicability and adequacy to predict the service life
   of ceramic claddings in Brasilia is demonstrated. The knowledge
   regarding the influence of the facades' characteristics on their
   durability is extremely useful to designers, in order to improve the
   selection of a given cladding for a specific situation, and to managers
   and stakeholders, allowing the optimization of maintenance policies and
   thus increasing the sustainability of the solutions adopted during the
   buildings' life cycle.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a comparative study of greenhouse gas emissions due
   to different wall compositions in accordance with their lifespans. The
   assessments carried out take into consideration the construction,
   maintenance and end of life of the walls, for a specific tropical
   climate site. The energy spent for heating and cooling during the
   utilization phase of the building was made equivalent for all
   calculations, in order to isolate the study on the evaluation of the
   performance of each technical solution. Initially, the methodology is
   described by choosing technical solutions to the building envelope,
   determining the corresponding service life for each solution and finding
   the corresponding GHG index from an appropriate database. Then, the
   evolution of this indicator is calculated within a given time for the
   four different technical solutions: Concrete Block; Solid Clay Brick;
   Cellular Concrete Block; Multicell Clay Brick. Brazilian national
   standard materials lifespans were adopted. A building lifespan of 150
   years was considered. The results of this analysis suggest and quantify
   the important impact of the lifespans of both the materials and the
   building itself on greenhouse gas emission indicators. The numerical
   results presented point out the need to revisit the current life cycle
   analysis practices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   conversion module, a set of deployment objectives, and assumed growth
   rates for deployment. It is independent of working details of the
   conversion technology. A set of equations is formulated and solved to
   model the deployment of the new technology. It allows for evaluation of
   gross and net produced energy and for estimation of required
   investments. The model is applied to photovoltaic electricity in Brazil,
   wind electricity globally and in Brazil, and sugar cane bioethanol. The
   main conclusions are: (i) photovoltaic electricity, because it requires
   large energy investments, leads to negative net production of
   electricity for many years, i.e., for an extended period it is an energy
   sink and not source; (ii) wind electricity is an attractive option is
   terms of net electricity production; (iii) sugar cane bioethanol is an
   attractive option for liquid fuels production for the world. (C) 2010

Title = {Efficiency, quality, and environmental impacts: A comparative study of
   residential artificial lighting},
Journal = {ENERGY REPORTS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {5},
Pages = {409-424},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The recent ban on conventional incandescent lamps for residential use
   led Brazilian consumers to choose from three main lighting technologies:
   incandescent halogen, CFL (Compact Fluorescent Lamp), and LED (Light
   Emitting Diode). Despite the fact that their electrical performances are
   well known, there are still some technical features to be discussed and
   compared. Therefore, this paper tends to show a comparative study of
   three low-cost lighting technologies. Laboratorial apparatus were used
   to measure electricity quality, electrical performance and photometric
   indicators. With the aid of the lumen method, the number of lamps needed
   to light a hypothetical apartment was evaluated. The consequent costs
   and environmental impacts were evaluated as well. This study finds out
   that LED lamps are clearly the best lighting option, considering the
   overall comparisons of the variables mentioned above. However, the
   tested LED lamp present some disadvantages as compared with the others,
   such as power factor, harmonic introduction and environmental impacts in
   manufacturing phase. Also, it was noted that there are some
   inconsistencies between measured lighting data and information given by
   manufacturers. Among the evaluated technologies, the incandescent lamp
   shows more measured values that are approximately the same as the values
   indicated by the manufacturer. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {A comparison is presented of the diffusion of the automobile In the
   metropolitan areas of Parts and Montreal and in two urban areas in
   developing countries-Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Puebla, Mexico. The
   comparison uses a demographic approach, based on the estimation of an
   age-cohort model. The model takes into account three combined aspects of
   time: the stage in the life cycle, the generation, and the period.
   Previous analyses conducted for developed countries indicated that the
   period effect (including the Influence of Income) could be considered as
   residual, in the face of stability of behavior of generations during the
   observed part of their life cycles. Models for the regions were
   estimated by using a series of transportation surveys (with the
   exception of Puebla). The results Indicate that comparable patterns can
   be observed with respect to the life cycle and generation effects,
   although the ages and generations at which maximum motorization occurs
   vary among countries, according to their different histories of
   diffusion of the automobile. On the other hand, the spatial pattern of
   household motorization presents some fundamental differences for the
   urban areas of developed and developing countries. Paris and Montreal
   have higher motorization in the suburbs, but the results for Sao Paulo
   and Puebla show the opposite, suggesting the relevance of income effects
   because the populations in suburban areas have lower income levels.},

Title = {GHG Emissions Assessment of Civil Construction Waste Disposal and
   Transportation Process in the Eastern Amazon},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The urbanization process represented by an increased supply of housing
   and transport infrastructure has taken place at an accelerated rate in
   several regions of Brazil, especially in the metropolitan areas of the
   Brazilian Amazon. Despite the existence of environmental policies that
   guide the proper disposal of civil construction waste (CCW) in Brazil,
   the impacts of these policies are still negligible, pointing to the need
   to establish other metrics such as the measurement of greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions in CO(2)eq associated with civil construction waste.
   This work aims to evaluate, in the second-largest city in the Brazilian
   Amazon, the environmental impact generated by the transportation of CCW
   to disposal sites, having as indicators the volume of this waste and the
   CO2 emissions produced during a whole year. A literature review on life
   cycle carbon emissions assessment in building construction and CO2
   emissions in transportation are provided to establish the background of
   the research methodology. Data collection was carried out by searching
   large generators of construction waste, the companies responsible for
   transporting construction waste, and the types of vehicles used.
   Calculation of GHG emissions from CCW transportation was based on the
   method described in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. The study identified a
   volume of waste of around 1244 m(3)/month, with a generation of 40,440
   kgCO(2)/year, only from small and large generators. Besides the damage
   identified in this study, there is also the dumping of CCW into urban
   streams in the city which is causing negative impacts on sanitation and
   drainage systems. The results point to the need to strengthen local
   policies to mitigate the impacts of the existing CCW to contribute to a
   more sustainable city.},

Title = {Implementing mechanical biological treatment in an emerging waste
   management system predominated by waste pickers: A Brazilian case study},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {162},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Mechanical Biological Treatment (MBT) could be a decisive game-changer
   for the development of household solid waste management (e.g., reduce
   waste in landfills). However, in a nascent household waste management
   (HSWM) system, which is characterized by divergent interest groups
   ranging from the national government, municipalities, waste pickers and
   householders as providers of waste, implementing MBTs could create
   positive but also adverse impacts, in particular on waste pickers (WPs).
   Formal WPs are in cities, like Belo Horizonte (Brazil), a constituent
   part of the HSWM. This study builds strategies as a form of normative
   scenarios to assist decision-making processes to deal with WPs and
   implement MBTs systems. The present study includes material and energy
   flows, life cycle environmental impacts and social indicators
   characterized by the number of active WPs and capacity building. The
   results show that an integrated commitment of the local society can
   reduce landfilling by 70\% and global warming emissions to a quarter. An
   emphasis on greenhouse gas emissions, like Belo Horizonte's promise for
   long-term attitude, brings a broad commitment to developing HSWM since a
   functioning system based on focused strategies will consequently reflect
   a positive action on climate. Waste pickers can fulfill the estimated
   vacancies at MBT plants and promote their active life or not according
   to the capacity building. MBT has substantial room to grow. Therefore,
   this growth will only happen with new thoughts on the adaptability of
   MBT systems focused on sufficiency to secure fair conditions for local
   livelihoods and targets with systemic implications.},

Journal = {BUILDINGS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The increase in rehabilitation actions motivated further research in the
   scope of service life and/or building maintenance. In defining rational
   strategies for the buildings' maintenance, reliable tools that model
   their performance over time are needed. This research evaluates the
   impact of maintenance actions on painted renderings. More specifically,
   the objective of this research is to adapt and extend an existing
   method, evaluating new periods of service life, with and without
   maintenance actions, in order to be able to regionalize and expand the
   existing results. This research was carried out based on an extensive
   fieldwork survey of painted renderings of facades in vertical buildings
   in the city of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, at different times (before,
   during and after the execution of maintenance actions). For renderings
   without maintenance actions, an average service life of 14 years is
   obtained. After maintenance actions, especially cleaning, the estimated
   average service life is 16 years. After maintenance, cleaning and
   partial repair actions, the estimated average service life is 34 years.
   For painted surfaces without maintenance actions, an average service
   life of 10 years is estimated. After cleaning actions, the estimated
   average service life is 11 years. After maintenance (cleaning, partial
   repair actions on renderings and repainting), the average service life
   is 15 years, until the last period of service life that precedes the end
   of the rendering's life cycle.},

Title = {Strategies to reduce CO2 emissions and increase temporary
   carbon stock in Brazilian housing using planted wood},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {49},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Wood is a biological material; it is renewable and widely used in
   construction projects around the world. One of its main features is its
   ability to capture CO2 from the atmosphere and temporarily store carbon;
   this helps to mitigate climate change. This research analyzes strategies
   to reduce CO2 emissions and increase temporary carbon storage in the
   Brazilian construction sector by promoting the long-term use of planted
   wood for housing purposes. To this end, two strategies are developed:
   the first (SS1) proposes to increase the yield of the primary processing
   performance of sawn wood by 7.0\%; the second (SS2) replaces the market
   share of wood products with a short life cycle (<1 year) with those with
   a long-life cycle (>40 years) in construction. It was found that,
   compared to the reference scenario, the implementation of SS1 and SS2
   can mitigate similar to 4\% (27.6 MtCO(2)) and similar to 1\% (89.9
   MtCO(2)), respectively, of accumulated emissions between 2024 and 2050.
   Temporary carbon storage can be increased by up to 6\% (8.3 MtC) via the
   increase in wood frame houses, or up to 15\% temporary carbon (20.4 MtC)
   via the increase in cross-laminated timber houses (hypothetical maximum
   potential values). A sensitivity analysis was performed considering
   native wood from both managed and unmanaged forests, and the results
   indicate that the proposals satisfy the objective only in the planted
   wood scenarios.},

   addition, the variables that comprised the three perspectives above were
   used for a descriptive reading of the evolutionary process from the
   perspective of intellectual capital during the stages.
   Design/methodology/approach The type of research used was quantitative
   with a descriptive character. For data collection, the authors have used
   the survey method and two complementary questionnaires were used as
   research tools. The measurement scale used in these instruments was the
   11-point Likert scale. In total, 100 Brazilian startups registered in
   the STARTUPBASE and residents in Sao Paulo comprised the sample of this
   research. For the data processing, it was used the exploratory factor
   analysis techniques, to identify the analysis factors, and the cluster
   analysis, to identify the OLC stages. Findings Based on the results
   obtained, four stages were identified and described to build the OLC
   model of this research: Stage I - conception and development; Stage II -
   organization and traction; Stage III - growth and scale; and Stage IV -
   consolidation and transition. In addition, the authors described the
   main lines of evidence found at each stage. Practical implications This
   research contributes to academic studies of the OLC in startups and the
   evolution of risks that originate from the relationship between external
   agents in the business environment and startups. Thus, a management map
   is built, which helps entrepreneurs and managers construct these
   businesses since such a management map allows identifying the risks and
   challenges that a startup needs to overcome to grow and develop.
   Originality/value The originality of this research lies in the
   adaptation of the OLC approach, which is widely used in studies
   analyzing the growth and development of mature organizations. The
   authors used this adaptation to analyze the growth and development of
   startups in Brazil. In addition, the identification and analysis of
   external agents that make up the business environment, as well as the
   analysis of the risks, originated from the relationships between the
   startup and these agents, brought original and essential results and
   discussions, both for OLC studies and for risk analysis studies in
   startups.},

Abstract = {Given the high amount of resources consumed and waste generated by the
   construction industry it was identified the need to seek for
   constructive systems that take into account three aspects of sustainable
   development - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced way.
   This paper aims at comparing through sustainability assessment in
   different industrialized building systems to the conventional system
   which are used in the construction of social housing in Brazil. An
   assessment that provides a way to improve production processes for
   sustainability of buildings is looked for, stimulating lower
   environmental impact, meeting the needs and providing conditions for
   their employees and users in the best cost/benefit ratio. (C) 2015 The

Title = {Investigations on energy efficiency enhancement under knock threshold
   limit conditions for a turbocharged direct-injection spark-ignition
   engine fueled with wet ethanol},
Journal = {APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Wet ethanol is a promising biofuel whose properties fit with
   turbocharged direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engines for
   countries with yearly production capacity. Even though it has a higher
   life-cycle efficiency than regular ethanol, which reduces significantly
   the energy required on ethanol production, wet ethanol's potential is
   wasted by the continuous dehydration process. In order to highlight such
   potential as a fuel for engines, this study investigates the early
   injection of different blends of wet ethanol (E100W0, E95W5, E90W10, and
   E80W20, respectively) via an in-house engine simulator to improve engine
   operating conditions - enhancing engine and ethanol's life-cycle
   efficiencies. This study searched for the highest sustainable values of
   engine energy and exergy efficiencies based on the threshold value of
   the knock index number. The combustion phasing model used correlations
   obtained from a machine learning algorithm fed with experimental data
   for a DISI engine. This investigation provided 120 different cases under
   different compression ratios (r), engine speeds, relative air-fuel
   ratios, and wet ethanol blends. Results showed that E80W20 can operate
   with a turbocharger at r = 18. The highest efficiencies (43\% and 40\%,
   respectively) were found for E90W10 and E80W20 - values 30\% higher than
   regular Brazilian FFV. Lastly, cases involving the best conditions for
   torque, lean air-fuel conditions at high compression ratios and water
   content, and downspeeding are presented as interesting alternatives to
   either stationary engines or hybrid vehicles, therefore highlighting the
   potential of wet ethanol for DI engines.},

   ceramic block masonry to produce the same 48m(2) single-family housing
   unit following the COHAB MG standard. The accounting of materials used
   for building production was made through a BIM platform, and
   subsequently, total embodied energy was calculated, weighted according
   to the amount of each material used. Results indicates that buildings
   constructed with GLT in Brazil can achieve up to a 40\% reduction in
   total embodied energy when compared to the traditional construction

   problems in adults and elderly in Brazil},
Journal = {CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {34},

Abstract = {The objective was to analyze the epidemiological characteristics of
   chronic back problems in Brazil and study the association between their
   prevalence and demographic and socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, and
   health conditions. The study used micro-data from the Brazilian National
   Health Survey (PNS), 2013. The epidemiological indicators were:
   prevalence, time with chronic back problems, life cycle (from young
   adults to the elderly), limitations in activities of daily living, and
   mean age at onset of symptoms, according to sex and age bracket. In
   order to analyze inequality in chronic back problems according to
   socioeconomic characteristics and risk factors, a multivariate logistic
   regression model was used, based on life cycle stages, with the presence
   of chronic back problems as the dependent variable and the following
   independent variables: sex, schooling, area of residence, race/color,
   self-rated health, types of chronic diseases, body mass index (BMI), and
   physical activity. Prevalence of chronic back problems in Brazil was
   18.5\%, and was higher in women than in men (21.1\%; 95\% CI:
   20.2-21.9). Mean age at onset of chronic back problems was 35 years.
   There was an association between chronic back problems and lower
   schooling, poor self-rated health, and presence of the majority of the
   selected chronic diseases. Area of residence, BMI, age, and race/color
   were weakly associated or not associated with chronic back problems.
   Prevalence of chronic back problems stabilized at 50 years of age, but
   the severity of limitations increased at older ages. As in other
   countries, high prevalence and the impact on living conditions revealed
   the need for epidemiological studies on chronic back problems in Brazil.
   The results suggest that health promotion and the prevention of chronic
   back problems should be intensified, especially before 50 years of age,
   considering the on-going population aging in Brazil.},

Abstract = {Resident fishes and their seasonal use of a surf zone were characterized
   and identified in the Jaguaribe beach, located on the Island of
   Itamaraca, state of Pernambuco, northeastern Brazil. Monthly towings
   (March 2006 to February 2007) with a beach seine net (20 m long, 1.5 m
   high, 5 mm mesh size) in different moon phases and periods of the day
   (day and night) were conducted. A total of 6,407 specimens, 35 families
   and 90 species were recorded. Seven species were considered as annual
   residents (Anchoa tricolor, Anchoviella lepidentostole, Bairdiella
   ronchus, Larimus breviceps, Lycengraulis grossidens, Polydactylus
   virginicus and Pomadasys corvinaeformis), three resident throughout the
   dry season (Conodon nobilis, Lile piquitinga and Menticirrhus
   americanus) and two resident species in the rainy period (Cathorops
   spixii and Nicholsina usta). Among these 12 species, concerning their
   life cycle, three of them (A. tricolor, C. spixii and L. piquitinga)
   showed only adult individuals, while B. ronchus, M americanus and N.
   usta were the only species represented exclusively by juvenile in both
   seasons. The surf zone of Jaguaribe beach presents a considerable
   ecological importance as it encompasses a great diversity of fishes,
   including species considered rare for this ecosystem, as well as species
   which are resident annually or seasonally. The distribution pattern of
   species found in this study shows that the ichthyofauna of the surf zone
   in Jaguaribe beach is rich, mainly dominated by small-sized individuals
   including juveniles of several species, with the presence of some
   species most commonly found in neighboring environments, such as
   seagrass beds, estuaries and reefs. As an integrated component of
   interconnected environments in coastal areas of Pemambuco, and owing to
   its function in the life cycle of coastal fishes, the surf zone
   ofJaguartibe beach presents an apparently common ecological pattern for
   tropical sandy beaches.},

Abstract = {In the Amazon, migratory catfishes of the genus Brachyplatystoma are
   apex predators that are important for fisheries and conservation. The
   life cycle of Brachyplatystoma platynemum Boulenger, 1898 is poorly
   known, although it has been hypothesized to be very similar to that of
   Brachyplatystoma rousseauxii Castelnau, 1855, which uses the entire
   length of the Amazon basin to complete its life cycle (from the Andes to
   the estuary). This study provides the first data on the migratory
   patterns of B.platynemum at the individual level using otolith
   microchemistry. In total, 94 individuals were sampled close to major
   breeding areas in the Amazon basin (78 fish from the middle and upper
   Madeira River and 14 fish from the upper Amazon), and their lifetime
   movements were assessed by measuring variations in Sr-87/Sr-86 along
   transverse sections of their otoliths (ear stones), using laser ablation
   multi-collector mass spectrometry (LA-MC-ICP-MS). The migrations of
   B.platynemum are not as extensive as those of B.rousseauxii, and do not
   involve natal homing. Furthermore, the estuary is not a nursery area, at
   least for fish hatched in the Madeira. Nevertheless, B.platynemum
   migrates several thousand kilometres within the Amazon basin, with
   transboundary displacements between at least Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru.
   Current and planned hydroelectric development in the Amazon basin will
   severely disrupt both migration and access to breeding grounds,
   ultimately affecting the recruitment and population dynamics of these
   apex predators. The conservation of B.platynemum is crucial for the
   stability of the Amazonian aquatic food webs. This requires building
   effective fish passage on the two existing Madeira dams and considering
   alternative options to the large-scale hydropower development in the
   Amazon basin.},

Title = {Potential use of rainwater as a tool for fire stations and firefighting:
   Literature review, environmental and cost assessments},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {898},
Month = {NOV 10},
Abstract = {Few studies in the literature integrate rainwater harvesting and
   firefighting. Thus, the general objective of this paper was to evaluate
   the potential use of rainwater as a source of water for firefighting. To
   do so, two approaches were pro-posed for the assessment. The first
   approach was the analysis of the existing literature. Two databases were
   evaluated as references in engineering fields, of which 32 articles
   mentioned rainwater as an alternative for firefighting. The main result
   of the review was the scarcity of articles in the area under study, with
   some of the existing articles focusing on forest fires. In contrast,
   others analysed the use of rainwater within the scope of buildings or
   fire stations. The sec-ond approach involved a case study that started
   by analysing the fire statistics provided by the Military Fire
   Depart-ment of the state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. It was observed
   that, between 2017 and 2020, building fires represented 25 \% of the
   state's fires and 50 \% of the water consumption in firefighting, while
   the rest of the fire occurrences rep-resented the other half of water
   consumption. Rainwater can be used not only to reduce the total
   consumption of po -table water but also as a logistics tool towards
   better response time in the event of a fire. With the firefighting water
   demand obtained, a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach was performed to
   assess the potential environmental opti-misation in a simplified scope.
   It was performed in a cradle-to-gate approach, leaving the potential
   optimisations in transport and logistics apart. Also, a cost assessment
   was carried out, obtaining a much lower cost for firefighting and
   providing financial savings for fire stations. As a result, rainwater is
   expected to decrease environmental impacts, help logistics in fire and
   save money for fire supression.},

Abstract = {Sixty Centropomus parallelus juveniles were collected in March 2013 in
   two locations (Tromomo and Guaraguacu) inside the Paranagua estuarine
   complex, southern Brazil. The habitat residency and movement patterns of
   the individuals were inferred from Sr:Ca ratios and age recorded in the
   otoliths. Data suggest that the species spawns preferentially in
   brackish areas mainly from October to January, and that growth rate
   during the early juvenile stage could be influenced by environmental
   salinity. Furthermore, the data also show that C. parallelus can occupy
   diverse salinity habitats and migrate among marine, brackish and
   freshwater areas within the Paranagua estuarine complex, showing a high
   environmental plasticity and adaptation. (C) 2016 The Fisheries Society

Abstract = {Construction accidents are one of the main indicators of the claims
   recorded at work all over the world. Identification of the causes and
   factors related to work accidents is essential for a proper analysis of
   risk and the consequent adoption of procedures and measures to achieve
   more effective prevention. Focus on rehabilitation and maintenance has
   increased worldwide and it is in this kind of construction that
   accidents are more frequent, principally motivated by a lack of planning
   and adequate projects that consider workers safety during the building
   life cycle. Studies have shown that the planning and project phases are
   essential in guaranteeing occupational safety during the maintenance and
   rehabilitation stages. Based on studies done in Portugal and Brazil
   during the past few years, this work puts forward the stakeholder's
   perspective on the main reasons for observed safety noncompliance and
   suggestions for procedures to improve these types of activities.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a brief analysis of the substitution of the main
   materials traditionally used in civil construction by less
   energy-intensive materials, their contribution to Energy Efficiency - EE
   and to the reduction of GHG emissions. For the analysis, the calculation
   method developed by Cruz (2018) was used considering three
   eco-indicators: energy - (kWh/m(2)), environmental - (tCO(2)/m(2)), and
   socioeconomic - relation between minimum wage and construction cost. The
   study does not intend to present the life cycle analysis of the
   construction industry or materials, considering that its focus is to
   perform an objective analysis through a direct method of evaluating the
   substantial energy of the materials and their equivalent GHG emissions.
   The final results present a representative case in the construction of

   occurrence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii and anti-Neospora caninum
   antibodies in 170 free-living capybaras in a residential park area in
   Itu Municipality, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Serum samples were tested by
   indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for T. gondii (IFAT >= 1: 16)
   and N. caninum (IFAT >= 1: 50). Among the 170 samples analyzed, 10\%
   (17/170) and 0\% (0/170) were seropositive for T. gondii and N. caninum,
   respectively. This study confirms the widespread presence of T. gondii
   and reinforces the role of capybaras in the life cycle of this parasite.
   Capybaras may not be important as intermediate hosts of N. caninum in

   patterns is examined, as well as their manifestations in different
   phases of the life cycle, including the very early childhood, childhood,
   adolescence and adult life. The stability of the patterns during the
   development and the hypotheses related to each pattern are discussed
   too. Since the Brazilian researches on this approach are practically
   restricted to attachment in childhood, unlike others countries, which
   are extending the AT to other phases of development, considerations
   about the necessity of more researches in Brazil focusing the approach
   of AT, mainly in adolescents, are presented.},

Abstract = {Building industry has a large environmental responsibility. All common
   materials have environmental impacts during their production process,
   but designers may choice the materials and techniques with less impact
   among the viable options. The objective of this work is to examine
   embodied energy in materials of two traditional constructive
   alternatives, in the region of Sao Leopoldo, a city in southern Brazil.
   Construction options considered are the reinforced concrete structure
   and the structural masonry. The study was developed under investigation
   of a social housing project typical in the region. We calculate the
   amounts of materials and the energy contained in them. The results
   indicated that the energy embodied in these two constructive systems is
   approximately 1.72 GJ.m(-2) and 1.26 GJ.m(-2), respectively. It may be
   concluded that the embodied energy is lower in the structural masonry
   system, with a reduction around to 1/4 in relation to the reinforced
   concrete option. The results can be used to help design decisions.},

Abstract = {Demographic interest in population and environment has grown in recent
   decades. One of the most prominent research areas in this tradition
   addresses the impact of population on land use and land cover change.
   Building on this tradition, we examine the effects of household
   demographic composition on land use and land cover on small farms in two
   study areas in the Brazilian Amazon. Fixed effects regression models of
   used area and forested area show few consistent effects of changes in
   household demography on land use and land cover change. Effects are
   inconsistent with the household life cycle model that currently
   dominates the literature on household demographic effects in frontiers.
   Changes in the number of children and women, particularly young women,
   have the most significant effects on land use and land cover change. We
   conclude by arguing that households strategically access cash for
   investment in agriculture and that specific strategies are determined by
   economic and institutional context.},

   larger number of MosquiTRAPs, but to quantify the number of females per
   house, one trap was sufficient. The sensitivities of MosquiTRAPs and
   manual aspirations to detect the presence of A. aegypti females were
   similar, but were lower compared to oviposition traps. The correlation
   coefficients between the number of females captured by MosquiTRAPs and

   low, which may be a consequence of each method showing different stages

Abstract = {Tropical deforestation remains a critical issue given its present rate
   and a widespread consensus regarding its implications for the global
   carbon cycle and biodiversity. Nowhere is the problem more pronounced
   than in the Amazon basin, home to the world's largest intact, tropical
   forest. This article addresses land cover change processes at household
   level in the Amazon basin, and to this end adapts a concept of domestic
   life cycle to the current institutional environment of tropical
   frontiers. In particular, it poses a risk minimization model that
   integrates demography with market-based factors such as transportation
   costs and accessibility. In essence, the article merges the theory of
   Chayanov with the household economy framework, in which markets exist
   for inputs (including labor), outputs, and capital. The risk model is
   specified and estimated, using survey data for 261 small producers along
   the Transamazon Highway in the eastern sector of the Brazilian Amazon.},

Title = {The importance of embayed coastal areas for the life cycle of two

Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {219},

Abstract = {Coastal embayed areas are important sites for many benthic and nektonic
   organisms that are being increasingly threatened by habitat degradation.
   The knowledge on the biology of these organisms can reveal the
   importance of such areas for their life cycles. Furthermore, population
   information is also imperative to recognize the importance of these
   species to structure coastal ecosystems and to provide support to
   management strategies. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the
   importance of a coastal embayment area for the generalist predator
   starfish Astropecten marginatus and Luidia senegalensis, analyzing their
   spatio-temporal distribution and populational parameters and evaluating
   whether (1) the species present a differential use of the area, (2) the
   species use the bay for recruitment, growth and reproduction and (3)
   there is an ontogenetic or gender related variation in the bay
   occupation. This study was carried out at Caraguatatuba Bay (SE Brazil),
   with monthly samples from July/03 to October/04. Although Astropecten
   was more abundant than Luidia, the two species had similar shifts in
   abundance, with peaks during cold/dry months, which are partly related
   to recruitment patterns. Species were distributed mainly towards the
   southern area of the bay, where A. marginatus had denser aggregations.
   Both species used the bay for recruitment, growth and reproduction.
   Males and females of both species occurred in similar numbers (sex ratio
   1:1), except in late autumn (May-June) when females became more
   numerous. An annual reproductive cycle was observed for both species,
   with spawning occurring mainly in the rainy season, and recruitment
   mainly during fall/winter. Large individuals ( > 17 cm) of L.
   senegalensis were sub-represented in the bay, indicating possible adult
   migration to deeper areas, whereas A. marginatus had a more resident
   behavior. Distribution of both species correlated well with diet
   information previously available, with prey partitioning suggested as a
   mechanism that allow their similar occupation of the area, and
   ontogenetic diet shifts explaining the adult migration of L.
   senegalensis. This highlights the relevance of feeding information to
   predict distribution of starfish. Our results elucidate the importance
   of the studied bay for the life cycle of these keystone species,
   elucidating species-specific vulnerabilities to coastal degradation and
   the importance of recognizing populational and distribution parameters
   in order to inform management policies.},

Abstract = {We investigate the effect of differential access to financial markets,
   discount factor and wealth endowment on poverty and inequality. We
   construct a model of educational and savings choice with heterogeneous
   agents. Motivated by empirical evidence, in this economy the return on
   savings is a non-decreasing function of the amount saved. As expected,
   more patient households tend to become wealthier and more educated. The
   heterogeneity on portfolio returns is shown to be key to our main
   result: the model closely fits the data on income and wealth
   inequalities, being able to explain the existing Brazil's inequality
   patterns. The model was also calibrated to the US, with similar fit. We
   then evaluate two types of public policies based on cash transfer
   schemes (CTSs), that aim to reduce poverty and inequality. We find that
   the CTS version in which receiving the benefit is conditional on
   educating the household's youngster outperforms its unconditional
   version in almost all dimensions analysed.},

   component to buildings made with gypsum plaster (commercial - CGP and
   recycled - RGP), and wastes (red ceramic - RC and porcelain - PW) by
   loading-pressure. Bricks were prepared with a solid mass composition
   containing 50\% (by weight) of binder, 50\% (by weight) of waste, and
   very small water/dried powder ratio (0.22). Specimens were molded with
   uniaxial loading-pressure (10 kN) before setting times. Compressive and
   flexural strengths, porosity, and microstructure were evaluated. The
   compressive results were in the range of 12.3 and 33.9 MPa, higher than
   the minimum required by Brazilian Standards to building components (>=
   2.5 MPa). The low water/solid mass ratio and the uniaxial
   loading-pressure before setting times contribute to decreasing the
   porosity, which was shown in the dense microstructure. The obtained
   results show that these components present a good quality building
   component. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Brazil increased 1.3\% points to its share of GDP spent on education,
   between 2005 and 2013, according to Organization for Economic
   Co-operation and Development (OECD) indicators. However, Brazilian
   government education policies are beginners, regarding to the improved
   of environmental quality. This paper presents a reflection about
   environmental assessment systems, LEED for Schools and AQUA-HQE, applied
   in two public school buildings in the southeastern region of Brazil. The
   evaluated public buildings were pioneers in those systems and up to now,
   are the only public school buildings constructed certified in the
   country. Environmental assessment systems are significant tools for
   improving school environmental quality. This research evaluates the
   management of post-occupancy in those buildings, highlighting the
   importance in reducing environmental impacts in this most longstanding
   period in buildings life cycle. The research concludes that despite
   being provided materials and techniques that reduce the costs and
   facilitate the maintenance of these buildings, the environmental quality
   can be maintained by performing the necessary maintenance.},

Journal = {ECONOMIC BOTANY},
Year = {1985},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Pages = {113-129},
Abstract = {Stands of babassu palms (Orbignya martiana) occupy an area of Brazil
   estimated at nearly 200,000 km2, concentrated in the states of Maranhao,
   Piaui and Goias. Babassu''s cryptogeal germination, establishing the
   apical meristem of the plant below ground for its early growth and
   development, enables it to survive human disturbance, making the palm an
   integral part of shifting cultivation and pastoral farming systems.
   People obtain a multitude of products from babassu throughout the
   palm''s life  cycle: leaves are used widely for thatch, basketry, and
   construction; trunks for palmito and bridges; the fruit for feed, oil
   and, charcoal. As many as 450,000 subsistence-level households rely on
   the sale of babassu kernels, used in a regional vegetable oil industry,
   for an important share of their cash incomes. Deforestation pressures
   and technological innovation toward an industry based on mechanical
   processing of whole babassu fruit threaten to reduce benefits the palm
   provides to the  region''s rural poor. Understanding how babassu is used
   by rural families who depend upon it will help to make current efforts
   at domesticating the palm and whole-fruit processing more responsive to
   human needs.},

Title = {Environmental assessment of residential buildings with an emphasis on
   water conservation},
Journal = {BUILDING SERVICES ENGINEERING RESEARCH \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {30},
Number = {1},
Pages = {15-26},
Abstract = {The construction, operation and demolition of buildings represent one of
   the most damaging human activities in the global environment nowadays
   and water use and conservation is one of the most representative
   environmental loads to be considered. Brazil, unlike some other
   countries, has not yet implemented its own body building environmental
   assessment. The development of an environmental assessment system
   requires the identification of the most important topics to be
   considered in each theme for each country or region, due to local
   environmental agenda. This article presents a summary of the main topics
   concerning water conservation considered in some international
   environmental building assessment systems and presents a proposal of
   topics to take into account in a Brazilian assessment system.
   Practical application: The civil construction industry is not only one
   of the biggest sectors in the economy but is also one of the greatest
   polluters. Along with standardisation, it is also necessary to establish
   measures to attract significantly higher levels in different topics
   related to sustainable construction. New mechanisms that allow users to
   recognise the difference between buildings with different sustainable
   performance levels need to be developed. This article will be used as a
   base for the development of a Brazilian system of assessment and rating
   for building environmental performance and sustainability in terms of
   water use and conservation.},

Abstract = {From January to April 2006, 37 specimens of Hemidactylus mabouia were
   collected in houses, in the municipality of Barbalha (7 degrees 20' S
   and 39 degrees 18' W), Ceara State, Northeast Brazil. Among the
   individuals captured, 17 were infected with pentastomids, totalling a
   prevalence of 45.9\%, which did not differ between sexes. Host size did
   not influence the infection intensity. Two species of pentastomids were
   found: Raillietiella frenatus and R. mottae. The prevalence of R.
   frenatus (43.2\%) was higher than R. mottae (2.7\%), whereas the
   infection intensity of R. frenatus was comparatively lower (1.8 +/- 1.4)
   than R. mottae (36 parasites in a single host). Overall mean intensity
   of infection was 3.8 +/- 8.4 pentastomids. We found no pentastomid
   infecting juvenile geckos. The parameters of infection in this host
   population are in accordance to the findings of other studies, in which
   the high parasitism rate was associated to the feeding habits of geckos
   living in houses and buildings. Hemidactylus mabouia is a new host to R.
   mottae and the infection by R. frenatus is the first record of the
   occurrence this pentastomid species in Brazil.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the knowledge of real
   estate market can be used to support user requirement identification. A
   construction project well adjusted to the user requirements increase
   value and causes minors changes during its life cycle. As a consequence,
   renewal, refurbishments, and demolition are less present, reducing waste
   generation, reworking and material consumption. It is especially
   important in housing customization markets. However, one of the
   challenges faced by designers is frequently concerned about how properly
   to identify user requirements, wishes and needs, which are on the
   essence of the briefing phase. In this context, real estate data can be
   useful to designers, since it reflects the users' evaluation of the
   building attributes. The research strategy uses a knowledge discovery
   mechanism, composed by five steps: (1) formulation of a general
   database; (2) specific data selection using Case-Based Reasoning; (3)
   enrichment of data-sample; (4) development of hedonic price models using
   regression analysis; and (5) simulation of the value of design
   alternatives. Based on an application of an hedonic price model, using
   data from the medium-class housing market of Porto Alegre, Brazil, the
   main results indicate that adjusted price models have sufficient
   detailing and statistical precision to support decisions in the initial
   stage of design.},

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of the potential uses of BIM for
   managing the maintenance and refurbishment of existing housing assets to
   propose thermal comfort and energy efficiency guidelines for future
   social housing projects in Brazil. To do so, a case study analysis of a
   residential development with social-environmental certification in the
   city of Garanhuns, Pernambuco, Brazil was performed, and a literature
   review on the use of BIM for residential unit maintenance was conducted.
   The standard house in the residential development was found to be
   noncompliant with the Brazilian standard for ventilation openings (NBR
   15.220). Therefore, three alternative layouts were created and analyzed
   to meet the requirements of the standard as well as the needs of the
   residents. The authors recommend that socio-environmental certifiers use
   BIM models so that energy performance and other simulations can be
   carried out. The study also proposes guidelines for BIM implementation
   in future government housing projects. These guidelines were grouped
   into five categories: BIM encouragement, energy efficiency, maintenance
   management, user requirement management, and continuous improvement. The
   significance of this study is in providing a path for the gradual
   implementation of BIM for maintenance and post-occupancy management in
   the Brazilian housing program.},

Abstract = {Objective: To describe the enterprise of the family approach, through
   interprofessional work, in the Family Health Strategy service in Brazil.
   Method: This is a comparative case study addressing a family perceived
   as being difficult to manage by the staff of a school health center.
   Household-based interviews were conducted with the instruments:
   Genograma, Ecomapa and Stages of the Family Life Cycle between March and
   April/2018, according to the Calgary Family Approach model. They were
   recorded in a field book, presented in a discursive way, including a
   survey of problems and the main interventions proposed to the family.
   Results: Recognition of the family context in its structure, development
   and functionality. It was evidenced weaknesses in family ties, conflicts
   between mother and daughter; relationships with social-community
   resources, with an emphasis on abusive alcohol consumption, the health
   situation of the key informant was presented as conditioning factors.
   The elaboration of the family therapeutic project considered the
   identification of possible solutions, adequate and accepted by the
   family.
   Conclusions: The presented case contributed potentially in how to guide
   the family approach, inferring in joint elaborations between
   multiprofessional team and the family. The proposition of intervention
   alternatives was conceived by a plural perspective of knowledge,
   surpassing a technicist rationality in health.},

Abstract = {In the recent decades, the high-resolution remote sensing, through 3D
   laser scanning and photogrammetry benefited historic buildings
   maintenance, conservation, and restoration works. However, the dense
   surface models (DSM) generated from the data capture have nonstructured
   features as lack of topology and semantic discretization. The process to
   create a semantically oriented 3D model from the DSM, using the of
   Building Information Model technology, is a possibility to integrate
   historical information about the life cycle of the building to maintain
   and improving architectural valued building stock to its functional
   level and safeguarding its outstanding historical value. Our approach
   relies on an ontology-based system to represent the knowledge related to
   the building. Our work outlines a model-driven approach based on the
   hybrid data acquisition, its post-processing, the identification of the
   building' main features for the parametric modeling, and the development
   of an ontological map integrated with the BIM model. The methodology
   proposed was applied to a large-scale industrial historical building,
   located in Brazil. The DSM were compared, providing a qualitative
   assessment of the proposed method.},

Journal = {CADERNOS DE SAUDE PUBLICA},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {33},
Number = {7},
Abstract = {The present study aims to describe the evolution of an intervention,
   using a methodology that adopts the critical event as the unit of
   analysis, and to identify strategic factors that facilitate the
   continuation of the interventions. Six critical events were identified:
   dispute care models for health; area of advice: dispute field; change
   policy; break of interorganizational relations; lack of physical
   structure and turnover of staff; difficulty in organizing practices in
   the work process. these are developed into strategic factors: enabling
   network of allies; meetings and educational activities/building
   capacity; benefits perceived by community members; mobilization of key
   actors; intervention's compatibility with the government's vision;
   restoration of interrelationship; and stability of the workforce. These
   strategic factors form a group of interrelated conditions that provide
   the strengthened linkages between elements in the intervention,
   supporting the hypothesis that they collaborate for the sustainability
   of the interventions in health. Tracking down the transformations of an
   intervention set by the critical events, it was verified that these
   factors performed a protective role at times of changes in the
   intervention process.},

Journal = {ENGENHARIA SANITARIA E AMBIENTAL},

Abstract = {Civil construction is one of the main generators of solid waste since
   the process of dismantling and demolition occurs frequently and, in most
   cases, without adequate planning. The aim of this paper is to analyze
   the dismounting process of two commercial buildings in San Francisco Bay
   (California, United States). For this study, a case study was conducted
   with two partial demolition projects. The first phase aimed to identify
   and analyze the management of recycling and reuse. The second phase
   focused on studying the deconstruction project and characterizing the
   deconstruction. Finally, the last phase quantified and constructed
   indicators on the recycled or reused materials. Results identified that
   developments 1 and 2 generated construction and demolition waste (CDW)
   of 63.7 and 21.5 kg/m2 during the deconstruction process, with recycling
   rates of 9.8\% and 81.3\%, respectively. Despite the legislation
   requiring the redirection of these materials, California, as well as
   Brazil, still lacks specific aspects in the legislation regarding waste,
   to encourage and require that these issues be considered still in the
   initial design phase of the construction.},

Abstract = {During a period of 28 months (January 2011-April 2013) periodical visits
   were made to four cattle slaughter houses to collect samples of lesions
   found in cattle slaughtered for human consumption. Three hundred and
   three lesions were collected, 25\% of which were caused by six different
   parasites: The metacestodes of Echinocccus granulosus (hydatid cysts),
   Fasciola hepatica, the metacestodes of Taenia saginata (Cysticercus
   bovis), Oesophagostomum radiatum, Eurythrema coelomaticum, and
   Paramphistomum cervi. Gross and microscopic aspects of the lesions
   caused by these worms are profusely illustrated and a detailed
   description of both pathological aspects, gross and microscopic, are
   provide in the hopes that the neophyte veterinary meat inspector can
   benefit from them in the task of recognition and interpretation of the
   significance of these lesion both to human and animal health. In regard
   to the two latter objectives, the life cycle, and the pathogenicity to
   the animal and human hosts, and the destination of the affected carcass
   or organ in the line of inspection are discussed for each parasite.},

Journal = {POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {46},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The Household Life Cycle framework relates family demographic processes
   to land use-cover change, but also revealed limitations. We propose
   several modifications, featuring a focus on extended families instead of
   single households, to broaden the applicability to land use systems. In
   the process, we pay particular attention to temporal dynamics and the
   spatial distribution of families concerning demographic processes, going
   beyond fertility to focus on population distribution. To evaluate the
   extended family model's explanatory value, we apply it to the
   Transamazon Highway region in Brazil. The analysis includes 330
   families, which are often multi-generational and multi-sited, based on
   data from 402 lots (1997/8-2005). We present models for forest,
   secondary succession, annual crops, perennials and pasture. Explanatory
   variables feature nine demographic factors with five others controlling
   for exogenous forces. The findings show strong effects for family
   dynamics and spatial distribution variables in many equations. Time on
   lot (cohort effect), the complexity of family structure (age effect) and
   social integration into urban fabric (spatial effect) are demographic
   processes that deserve further attention in land use studies.},

Abstract = {Given the number of innovations and the fast technological development,
   most products have been having their life cycle reduced, thereby
   increasing the amount of consumer goods waste to be absorbed by nature.
   The National Policy on Solid Waste (NPSW) of Brazil aims to accomplish
   integrated management and the management of solid waste so as to assign
   environmentally correct destinations to consumer waste of goods. In this
   context, this research aims to analyze the current situation of the
   management of household solid waste in the city of Florianopolis. The
   study was conducted at the company's Companhia Melhoramentos da Capital
   (COMCAP), and it is characterized as being a descriptive and case study.
   Primary data were collected through interviews. Interviews were
   conducted with four representatives of the company and a representative
   of civil society. Based on the data obtained, it was found that, despite
   serving over 90\% of the population, it is not very efficient, since the
   recycling rate is low. In addition, there are few options for treatment
   and disposal of waste and the operational structure, according to the
   theoretical framework adopted, is flawed.},

Title = {Seasonal variation of estuarine birds from Trapande Bay, Cananeia,
   Brazil},
Journal = {OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {70},
Pages = {1-17},
Abstract = {Estuaries are important environments for birds as resting and foraging
   sites. Therefore, information about the abundance, distribution, and
   biology of bird populations are necessary for preservation of such
   ecosystems. In this work, we studied the dynamic population of birds at
   Baixio do Arrozal, Trapande Bay, Cananeia Estuary on the southern coast
   of Sao Paulo state, Brazil. As an original hypothesis, we expected that
   the species abundances would display differences across months and
   seasons. Using the point count method, bird data were collected monthly
   between April and December 2013. For comparing the assemblages, a bar
   chart of the total abundance as a function of the monthly frequency was
   used along with boxplot graph of this index as a function of the
   seasons. We also investigated variations in the abundance of some
   specific bird populations. The results obtained for the total abundance
   indicated a seasonal pattern, peaking during the warmer months. The
   population analyses showed a greater abundance occurring in
   spring/summer, and a decrease of resident species populations in the
   winter. Migratory birds were recorded in the autumn and spring,
   following the migratory movements.This demonstrated that bird
   assemblages varied according to seasons due to the life cycle and the
   population sizes. Therefore, Baixio do Arrozal is an important
   environment for avifauna, which use the area throughout the year and
   need to be preserved.},

Volume = {167},

Abstract = {In areas of the Cerrado biome (Brazilian savanna) with well-defined
   rainy and dry seasons, changes in climate and landscape affect the
   abundance and seasonality of insects. Larvae of the antlion Myrmeleon
   brasiliensis (Navas) (Neuroptera: Myrmeleontidae) are predators that
   build traps in dry sandy soil to capture prey. Here we determined the
   effect of rain on trap building by M. brasiliensis larvae in a riparian
   forest in the Cerrado biome. Differences in population size and
   developmental stage were found between the rainy and dry seasons. In the
   laboratory, the effect of rain-soaked soil on trap building was
   evaluated. Fewer antlion larvae were found in the rainy season.
   Moreover, a greater abundance of larvae in the final stage of
   development (third instar) was found in the dry season, whereas more
   first instars were found in the rainy season. The latter revealed that
   wet soil affects the trap building of the larvae, as smaller traps were
   built in the treatment with soaked soil (simulated rain), whereas the
   larvae in the control treatment (no rain) continued building traps with
   no change in size. The findings indicate that seasonality in the Cerrado
   biome exerts a short-term influence on M. brasiliensis larvae (larvae
   build fewer traps) as well as a long-term influence (association with
   life cycle).},

Abstract = {Successful entrepreneurs of a large retail chain for clothing-the Lojas
   Renner, decided to address gender, as well as job and income generation
   issues, in a challenging experience that involved several stakeholders
   in the new markets where they established their business. In 2007 they
   launched the `Mais Eu' (More me) social campaign aligned with the
   business, aiming to increase women's professional qualifications, job
   and income generation. The key concern relied upon the content of the
   communication, in order to promote a deep adaptation to regional tastes
   and habits, respecting the different lifestyles. The institutional
   advertising campaign focused on the concept of woman and her
   relationship with important symbols such as family, considering
   different phases of her life-cycle (teenager, mother with children, and
   housewife in her home routine) and different women's styles. This
   approach nationalized the concept and the importance of women from all
   Brazilian regions, enabling identification and awareness. The objectives
   of this paper are: (a) to present the campaign, as it could serve as a
   model to be replicated by other companies, in emergent or developing
   countries; and (b) to analyze the campaign using the theoretical
   framework of the Ethics of Care.},

Title = {The environmental impact of Brazilian adults' diet},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {272},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Over the last years, dietary environmental impact and sustainable diets
   have been responsible for worldwide concern, especially in developed
   countries. Brazil is among the world's largest greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emitters and the country does not have any specific food consumption
   measures to achieve the promise made at COP21. The main objective of our
   paper is analyzing the contribution of the Brazilian diet in terms of
   carbon, water and ecological footprint. We collected data in the
   National Dietary Survey for food intake and life cycle assessment
   literature database to estimate the composition of the current diet in
   Brazil. We used independent t tests and ANOVA tests to understand the
   differences among sociodemographic and income characteristics related to
   Brazilian adults' diet. The environmental impact related to the
   Brazilian diet is very high, with beef consumption contributing to the
   largest share. Male household heads, with medium and low income, aged
   between 18 and 45 years old, with intermediate or less education level,
   who lives in rural areas in Midwest and Northeast regions were
   associated with higher environmental impact. Therefore, measures related
   to demand have great potential to reduce the environmental impact in
   Brazil. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING},

Abstract = {3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) is presented as an important process in the
   future of civil engineering, as it accelerates the construction process,
   reduces labor costs, and potentially generates significantly less waste
   materials. Currently, 3DCP has been delayed as a technical solution for
   Latin American. However, it could be an important option for tackling
   the housing deficit in developing countries as well. The deployment of
   3DCP depends on many different local factors, either political,
   economic, or technological. This paper discusses the potential,
   challenges, and research needs to deploy 3DCP in Brazil. It starts
   presenting the Brazilian economic context in the struggle to reduce the
   housing deficit over the years. Then, the challenges related to the
   implementation of 3DCP are compared with the opportunities, such as the
   abundance of low -carbon materials (earth -based, biomass, etc.), which
   could turn 3DCP into a sustainable business. Although this review is
   focused on Brazil, the authors believe that the context also applies to
   many other developing countries with similar social inequality
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Schistosomiasis is a serious public health issue in the world infecting
   more than 200 million people. In Maranhao state, Brazil, the disease has
   a high prevalence in the Baixada Maranhense microregion, where the
   socioeconomic conditions, high prevalence of freshwater snails, elevated
   incidence of human infection, and large rodent populations make the area
   highly conducive to the life cycle and persistence of schistosomiasis.
   The objective of this study was to record the perception of residents
   and health/public education professionals regarding this parasitosis and
   also understand their knowledge of the relationship between
   schistosomiasis and the environment. We conducted 53 interviews
   addressing the socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental issues
   surrounding schistosomiasis. It was recorded that the population
   believed the environment is the main cause of the disease and the
   fisherman may be stigmatized by their chance of having the disease.
   Health/public educational professionals in the region indicated that
   there were no regular educational campaigns, which contributed to the
   high rates of reinfection and the difficulties in preventing and
   controlling the spread of the disease. These data clearly demonstrate
   the need for interdisciplinary work that engages the community in
   gathering and disseminating knowledge and developing solutions to
   minimize the occurrence of this major health issue in the region.},

   absence, in almost all producing countries, including Brazil, specific
   legislation establishing management guidelines and monitoring of
   nanotechnology throughout their life cycle. For the bibliographic
   analysis, we describe some principles and indicators that should be
   adopted as supervisory measures and preventive management of risks of
   nanotechnological development, in order to ensure legal security to
   those involved in the process and nanotechnology production, among which
   the approach precautionary and mandatory specific regulations. Also
   pointed out some strategic proposals for risk management, including
   controls in the workplace, volunteer programs and insurance. We conclude
   that the risk management of nanotechnology can be done at various
   levels, including government regulatory agencies in the definition of
   environmental, health and safety, companies in the implementation of
   industrial management programs and hygiene products and insurers in the
   formulation coverage and pricing policies.},

Abstract = {The construction sector is responsible for high levels of energy
   consumption and for environmental impacts during the life cycle of a
   building all over the world. Therefore, sustainability has become an
   inherent topic in building design, in response to the stringency of
   natural resources and to performance. A way to design sustainable
   buildings is taking advantage of the available natural resources on site
   to reduce the needs for artificial conditioning. Requirements of
   performance have become more restrictive and existing buildings must
   conform to them. This is possible through a retrofit process which
   improves their performance to comply with actual requirements, besides
   improving the comfort of their occupants. Most of the developed
   procedures for retrofitting analysis take into account only energy
   consumption and emission of pollutants. The aim of this paper is to
   demonstrate a procedure to help designers and decision makers on
   choosing the best retrofit strategy considering energy consumption,
   thermal comfort and the cost-benefit of these strategies. A
   computational model of a building located at the State University of
   Campinas was developed to simulate different passive strategies and the
   results obtained are presented in an easy-to-use chart as part of the
   procedure.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON ENGINEERING MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {71},
Pages = {14846-14860},
Abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is transforming the construction
   life cycle. Nonetheless, there is a notable gap in research regarding
   the key challenges associated with BIM. This study aims to investigate
   the primary challenges in the design phase and their implications for
   project success. To address these objectives, cross-country case studies
   were conducted in four large engineering companies from the USA, Canada,
   Brazil, and United Arab Emirates. Data were collected through 23
   semi-structured interviews with managers, engineers and directors, and
   content analysis was performed using NVIVO software. The resulting
   coding structure revealed the following categories: organizational and
   cultural issues, professional and knowledge issues, technological and
   operational issues, cost issues, BIM specific issues, design issues,
   data issues, and information and communication issues. The findings
   highlighted the most significant challenge as the lack of BIM knowledge
   or expertise. Additionally, an important enabler in the design phase is
   the accuracy of data provided by BIM, which enhances project management
   analysis. Finally, the BIM challenges and enablers influence various
   benefits dimensions, particularly on the efficiency.},

Abstract = {The present paper describes the morphological modifications occurring
   during the larval development of Habronema muscae (Nematoda:
   Habronematidae) in Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae), along with the
   reactions caused by parasitism and the migration route of the nematodes
   inside the flies. Houseflies were reared on faeces of a H.
   muscae-infected horse, then dissected and processed by histology. The
   experimental part of the study was performed in 1996 in the
   Parasitological Experimental Station W.O. Neitz, Federal Rural
   University of Rio de Janeiro, Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil.
   Three different larval stages of H. muscae were recovered, measured and
   described. The encapsulation of larval nematodes was found in the third
   larval instar (L3) of M. domestica and cryptocephalic pupa. The mature
   capsules were observed in dipteran L3, pupae and mainly adults. In 1
   day-old or more M. domestica adults an active rupturing of capsules by
   H. muscae 13 and the migration to the head through the circulatory
   system and insect hemocoel were observed. Infective H. muscae L3s
   remained exclusively in the head of adult 5 days-old or more M.

Journal = {ACTA SCIENTIARUM-TECHNOLOGY},

Pages = {617-621},
Abstract = {The major problem on geotechnical work is to ensure that no settlements
   occur during the life cycle of the construction. This involves proper
   design of foundations and their bearing capacity. The Brazilian standard
   for design and execution of foundations, ABNT (2010) NBR 6122 imposes
   the utilization of field tests when designing building foundations. The
   Standard Penetration Test, SPT, ABNT (2001) NBR 6484, is still the most
   common in-situ test for those purposes. Ranzini (1988) suggested
   supplementing the conventional SPT with the measurement of the torque
   (SPT-T) required to turn the split spoon after driving, in order to
   provide a `static' component to a `dynamic' test. The adhesion between
   the soil and the sampler, obtained by the torque measurement, could be
   used to calculate the lateral skin friction of piles. This paper
   describes the SPT-T procedure including both a supplementary equipment
   and practical aspects. Also it presents an accurate torque measurement,
   a prediction method to calculate the bearing capacity of piles used in
   building foundations using the SPT-T test and a comparison between the
   estimated bearing capacities of building foundations with instrumented
   load tests in order to validate the method.},

Abstract = {Triatominae are insects notorious as vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, which
   is the etiologic agent of Chagas disease, and other trypanosomatids.
   Triatomines of the genus Rhodnius are primarily sylvatic, nevertheless
   the occurrence of native species that invade households suggests their
   possible role in the transmission of Chagas disease. Rhodnius
   montenegrensis was first described in 2012, but the biological aspects
   of this species are still unknown. This study aimed to analyze the
   biological aspects of R. montenegrensis under laboratory conditions. The
   emergence rate was 63.0\%, the mean time required for the emergence was
   13.9 +/- 1.7 days, the biological cycle from egg to adult phase occurred
   in 105.2 +/- 9.2 days, the number of bloodmeals required for each
   nymphal stage to reach the next stage varies between a minimum of two
   and a maximum of seven. The weight gained after a bloodmeal varied
   between 10.6 times on 1st-instar nymphs and 3.9 times on 5th-instar
   nymphs. The adult specimens had the lowest gain of weight, reaching 2.2
   times on females and 1.6 times on males. The sex ratio observed was 1:1.
   These data are relevant to understand the life cycle of this new
   described species and to elaborate more effective vector control
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Hydropower plants (HPPs) play an important role in the Brazilian energy
   matrix, largely in the Amazon region where the largest amount of
   hydropower generation potential is found. Therefore, this study aimed to
   analyze socioeconomic impacts caused in the stages of building and
   operating a large HPP in the Legal Amazon region. For such a purpose,
   the socioeconomic impacts detected in environmental studies of five
   projects (Belo Monte, Jirau, Peixe Angical, Sao Manoel and Sao Salvador)
   were analyzed. Socioeconomic impacts were sorted out according to the
   stage of their life cycle (construction and operation); these impacts
   were compared using a matrix and a descriptive analysis of data. Many
   similarities and correlations between the socioeconomic impacts were
   found in five studies. During the analysis, it was found that numerous
   impacts were improperly mitigated in these studies. Furthermore, social
   costs, such as population relocation, are typically underestimated, and
   gains brought by operating the HPP are overestimated. It is expected
   that an assessment of socioeconomic impacts caused by HPP in the Legal
   Amazon is going to allow broadening discussions about these
   constructions in areas of socioenvironmental sensitivity. Moreover, it
   is found that socioeconomic impacts in assessed studies are associated
   with multiple conflicts between the population affected by the project,
   government, and enterprise.},

Abstract = {Introduction: This work was an epidemiological investigation of the risk
   of Trypanosoma cruzi transmission in the rural Quilombola community of
   Furnas do Dionizio, State of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Methods: Of the
   71 animals examined, seven were captured (two opossums, Didelphis
   albiventris; four rats, Rattus rattus; and one nine-banded armadillo,
   Dasypus novemcinctus) and 64 were domestic (one canine, Canis
   familiaris; five pigs, Sus scrofa; two bovines, Bos taurus; five
   caprines, Capra sp.; and 51 ovines, Ovis aries). Parasitological tests
   were performed to detect parasites in the blood and to identify the
   morphology of flagellates. These methods included fresh examinations,
   buffy coat tests and blood cultures. Molecular analysis of DNA for
   identification of trypanosomatids was performed by polymerase chain
   reaction (PCR) with primers S35 and S36. Results: The parasitological
   tests showed flagellates in an opossum and two cattle. The molecular
   tests showed DNA from T. cruzi in an opossum and a pig. Triatoma sordida
   was the only triatomine species found in the community, and it colonized
   households (four specimens) and the surrounding areas (124 specimens).
   Twenty-three specimens tested positive for flagellates, which were
   subsequently identified as T. cruzi by PCR. Conclusions: Data analysis
   demonstrated that T. cruzi has a peridomestic life cycle that involves
   both domestic and wild mammals.},

Journal = {MATERIA-RIO DE JANEIRO},

Abstract = {Cross laminated timber panels (CLT) are formed by large-sized
   orthogonally arranged wood layers bonded with structural adhesive under
   high pressure. The cross-lamination system provides to the CLT to work
   as a rigid and self-supporting structural element. In addition, they are
   thermal and acoustic insulation and have a good resistance in fire
   situations. They are used as structural and closing elements in
   multi-floor constructions and this constructive system can be considered
   more sustainable, which generates less impact to the environment,
   compared to traditional Brazilian solutions. Wood is a renewable natural
   resource and when used in construction it plays an important role for
   the environment: storing CO2 and using low energy for its manufacture
   and application when compared to conventional materials used in
   construction such as steel, concrete and aluminum. In these structures
   design there is still no universally accepted analytic approach by CLT
   designers and manufacturers. In this work, the CLT panels used as floor
   or roof slabs subject to bending are dimensioned the most important
   methods used. The results were compared and it was concluded that the
   more accurate methods consider the rigidity and structural resistance of
   all layers. Greater precision in the designing of the CLT panels
   contributes to sustainable engineering as it optimizes the use of the
   material in the structure.},

Abstract = {In this study, rodents (Rattus rattus) and mollusks (Achatina fulica)
   were captured in a small forest located in a large metropolitan city in
   Brazil, and they were examined to investigate possible parasitism by
   Angiostrongylus cantonensis. The parasites were recovered as helminths
   from the pulmonary arteries of the synanthropic rodents and as
   third-stage larvae (with Metastrongylidae family characteristics) from
   the mollusks. To confirm the species, these larvae were used to
   experimentally infect Rattus norvegicus for the posterior recovery of
   adult helminths. To identify the adult helminths, morphological,
   morphometric, molecular, and phylogenetic techniques were employed.
   Furthermore, we also characterized the histological lesions associated
   with parasitism in naturally infected definitive hosts. Our results
   demonstrated the occurrence of a natural life cycle of A. cantonensis
   (with the presence of adult helminths) in definitive hosts, Rattus
   rattus, and third-stage larvae in an intermediate host, A. fulica. In
   free-living rodents, lesions of granulomatous pneumonia in the lungs and
   meningitis in the brain were also found. These results warn of the risk
   of accidental transmission of A. cantonensis to human residents around
   the park because of the extensive interaction among the fauna of the
   park, domestic animals, and the surrounding human population.},

Abstract = {A proper assessment of heating systems for swimming pools should
   evaluate the compromise between comfort level and the willingness to pay
   for it. The present work presents a multi-objective optimization of
   indirect solar assisted heat pump systems for outdoor swimming pool
   heating. Four different configurations are reported; (airto-water heat
   pump and three solar assisted heat pumps, air-to-water, water-to-water
   and a dual-source); and evaluated in six different locations (three
   location in Chile: Antofagasta, Santiago, and Concepcion; and three
   locations in Brazil: Brazilia, Sao Paulo, and Florianopolis). The
   methodology approach configures two objectives optimization, the
   minimization of the Annualized Life Cycle Cost (ALCC) and the
   maximization of the comfort level offered by the swimming pool. The
   optimization scheme consists of using a combination of tools: the
   energy-savings potential of i-SAHP are evaluated using the TRNSYS
   software in combination with GenOpt; and the economic modeling and
   optimization are performed in the MATLAB environment, using an
   approximation model and variant of NSGA-II genetic algorithm for
   building the Pareto frontiers. The optimization results demonstrate that
   solar-assisted configurations present significant improvements in
   performance for almost all locations, reaching the same levels of
   comfort at lower ALCCs when compared with the ASHP configuration.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present a summary of the current knowledge of
   Lycengraulis grossidens, a widely distributed coastal fish that occurs
   from Belize to Argentina. This species is abundant in estuaries along
   the Southwest Atlantic Coast and is important for recreational fishing,
   and as bycatch of shrimp fisheries. We compiled data available on
   taxonomy, phylogeny, ecology, fisheries and organized conceptually the
   life cycle of the species according to modem estuarine-use
   classification. Our review showed that along its geographic distribution
   and inside some particular environments (i.e., estuaries and costal
   lagoons) the species have been classified in a variety of ways in order
   to describe the remarkable complexity of habitat use that varies from
   freshwater resident, anadromous, marine migrant, estuarine resident,
   marine stragglers, catadromous to semi-catadromous. We conclude that L.
   grossidens is able to reproduce either in freshwater or estuarine water
   and postulate that it has a high plasticity in habitat use and life
   history, with migratory and resident contingents in the same local
   population. There seems to be a latitudinal change in migratory behavior
   of this species along the South America Coast, prevailing anadromous or
   semi-anadromous pattern at higher latitudes and marine migrants at the
   tropical northeast coast of Brazil.},

Abstract = {One of Daniel Hogan's lasting impacts on international demography
   community comes through his advocacy for studying bidirectional
   relationships between environment and demography, particularly
   migration. We build on his holistic approach to mobility and examine
   dynamic changes in land use and migration among small farm families in
   Altamira, Para, Brazil. We find that prior area in either pasture or
   perennials promotes out-migration of adult children, but that
   out-migration is not directly associated with land-use change. In
   contrast to early formulations of household life cycle models that
   argued that aging parents would decrease productive land use as children
   left the farm, we find no effect of out-migration of adult children on
   land-use change. Instead, remittances facilitate increases in area in
   perennials, a slower to pay off investment that requires scarce capital,
   but in pasture. While remittances are rare, they appear to permit sound
   investments in the rural milieu and thus to slow rural exodus and the
   potential consolidation of land into large holdings. We would do well to
   promote the conditions that allow them to be sent and to be used
   productively to keep families on the land to avoid the specter of
   extensive deforestation for pasture followed by land consolidation.},

Abstract = {The role played by a southwestern Atlantic mangrove in the breeding
   activity of estuarine fishes was evaluated. This fish assemblage
   represented 85 \% of the total catches of the experimental fishery
   surveyed between 1993 and 1997. To evaluate the maturation and spawning
   processes, qualitative (macroscopic stages of maturation) and
   quantitative (gonadosomatic index) attributes were considered which were
   combined in a reproductive activity index. Four types of occupation were
   found in the mangrove, according to the reproductive patterns presented
   by each species. It was estimated that the Guaratuba mangrove is used as
   a spawning site - either regularly or occasionally - by about 40 \% of
   the species, that make up 41 \% to 46 \% of the total abundance of this
   fish assemblage. However, besides the spawning species, the mangrove
   attracts other species at advanced stages of maturation. The use of
   mangrove habitat for reproductive activity by the species is 52 to 57 \%
   of the total fish abundance. Spring and summer are the seasons most
   associated with the maturation and spawning processes. Although most of
   the assemblage is formed by species that do not permanently inhabit the
   system, the Guaratuba mangrove is a significant site for the life cycle
   of estuarine and marine species occupying this coastal region. (C) 2000

Abstract = {Global warming is one of the most worrying environmental problems
   nowadays. A joint effort has been made by many countries to minimize
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, responsible for global warming. The
   evidences indicate that global warming is occurring due to anthropogenic
   activities, mainly caused by the using of fossil or biomass fuels.
   Although this effect is more directly associated with external
   emissions; domestic emissions also have their contributions. In this
   way, cooking activities can have an impact on global warming, since the
   main fuels used for these purposes are from fossil or biomass origin.
   This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the most common fuels used
   for cooking in Brazil on global warming. Among the fuels studied and the
   data available to date, biogas, followed by natural gas and liquefied
   petroleum gas were the least polluting, even the latter two being
   derived from petroleum and currently considered the great villain of air
   pollution. The results also show that although LPG is the most used fuel
   (>90\%) in Brazil for cooking, firewood, which accounts for only 3\% of
   consumption, causes the highest emission rates of greenhouse gases.
   Therefore, more efficient stoves can have a significant impact on the
   GHG reductions in the country.},

Abstract = {In Brazil, the largest share (51.4\%) of municipal solid waste is
   composed of organic matter; however, composting is rarely used as a
   treatment technology. In 2008, only 3.8\% of Brazilian municipalities
   had access to composting plants and about 11.6\% of municipalities
   destined the municipal solid waste to recycling plants. This is only
   1.4\% of waste generated. Recycling and composting are key programs for
   municipalities to reduce environmental impact. Therefore, this study
   aims to evaluate the environmental impact of inserting a recycling,
   composting and integrated program in a region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil
   through the Waste Reduction Model method simulation of greenhouse gases
   emission (carbon dioxide equivalent and carbon equivalent) and energy
   use. The results show that recycling and composting can minimize the
   emission of greenhouse gases, reducing carbon dioxide and carbon
   equivalents, and promote energy savings. The best result is the
   integration of these techniques, which can reduce 78.8\% of carbon
   dioxide and carbon equivalents and save 490.9\% in energy versus
   baseline scenario. This study supports municipalities creating scenarios
   as a tool for planning and decision making to reach targets proposed by
   solid waste policies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Giarrlia duodenalis, a unicellular, eukaryotic, and
   flagellated protozoan, presents two evolutionary forms in its life
   cycle, namely, trophozoites and cysts. It causes diarrhea in humans,
   dogs, cats, rodents, and ungulates. Despite being morphologically
   similar, the isolates of G. duodenalis are genetically diverse,
   affecting the stability and unanimity of taxonomic classification. Since
   different Giardia assemblages may occur within one isolate, multilocus
   genotyping is recommended for the genetic identification.
   Methodology: To determine the frequency of G. duodenalis infections in
   domiciled dogs in Cuiaba Municipality (State of Mato Grosso, Midwestern
   Brazil) and characterize its genetic variability, fecal samples were
   collected from 147 dogs.
   Results: Overall, 6.8\% (10/147) of the samples presented cysts of G.
   duodenalis, which sequencing and genotypic characterization using tpi
   and gluD revealed assemblages C and A, genetic grouping of G.
   duodenalis. Only three samples amplified by tpi and one sample amplified
   by gluD.
   Conclusions: The risk factors age, gender, breed, diet and the presence
   of other dogs in the same house were not correlationated with
   giardiasis. The host-specific and zoonotic genotype warns of the risk of
   inter and intraspecies transmission and it provides, for the rust time,
   information about genetic characterization of G. duodenalis isolates in
   dogs in Cuiaba, Midwest region of Brazil.},

Abstract = {One of the environmental impacts that presents great concern nowadays,
   the green-house gases (GHG) emissions affect decision-making from both
   government and private sector. Within this concern is the soybean
   biodiesel production growing that takes place in Brazil and Rio Grande
   do Sul State, this last one of main producers of soybean. Based on this,
   GHG emissions accounting from soybean cultivation and their potential
   environmental impacts depend on an inventory performing that presents a
   reality as close as possible in relation to Rio Grande do Sul State.
   Thus, this work aimed to trace how the soybean cultivation has developed
   for 20 years at Rio Grande do Sul State (between 1992 and 2013). During
   this research, a soybean growing, mainly on temporary croplands, that
   results in a different accounting in relation to current inventories
   that show soybean cultivation moving forward on forests areas was found.
   In this case, it was verified that this work, following The
   Intergovernmntal Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology, the land
   use change (LUC) occurred in only 15.4\% of the area, where soybean
   cultivation moved forward for 20 years. Finally, this work suggests
   future discussion for methodologies that encompass soybean cultivation
   advanced over wetland areas according to what is pointed out in this
   study.},

Abstract = {The foraging activity of Geotrigona mombuca Smith, 1863 was studied
   under natural conditions aiming to verify the influence of seasonal
   changes on daily flight activity and annual cycle of the colony. Daily
   flight activity was monitored for a year based on the observation and
   counting of foragers leaving and entering the hive, as well as the kind
   of material transported and meteorological factors such as day time,
   temperature and relative humidity. The influence of seasonal changes was
   evidenced by alterations on daily rhythm of flight activity and by
   differences on transportation of food resources, building material and
   garbage. These data indicate that forager behavior is related to daily
   microclimate conditions and it is synchronized with the requirements of
   colony annual cycle, which determines an intense pollen collection in
   the summer. Thus, the recomposition of the intranidal population in
   spring and summer can be ensured, which is characterized both for a
   higher intensity of flight activity and increase in garbage and resin
   transport, as well as the swarming process in the spring. In this way,
   an action targeting the preservation or management of the species in a
   natural environment should consider that survival and reproduction of
   the colony depends greatly on the amount of available pollen in late
   winter.},

Abstract = {The bat tick Ornithodoros mimon Kohls, Clifford \& Jones is currently
   known by only few reports in Bolivia, Uruguay, Argentina, and the state
   of Sao Paulo in southeastern Brazil. Here, we expand the distribution of
   O. mimon in Brazil to the states of Minas Gerais (southeastern region),
   Goias (central-western), Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte
   (northeastern). Ticks were collected on human dwellings, where there had
   been repeated complains of tick bites on persons during the night. Tick
   bites were generally followed by intense inflammatory reactions that
   lasted for several weeks at the bite site. Bats and opossums were
   reported to inhabit the attic of the infested houses. In addition, a
   free-ranging opossum (Didelphis albiventris Lund) trapped in Rio Grande
   do Norte was found infested by argasid larvae. Based on morphological
   and/or molecular analysis, all ticks were identified as O. mimon. From
   one of the sites (Tiradentes, state of Minas Gerais), 20 field-collected
   nymphs were tested by a battery of polymerase chain reaction protocols
   targeting tick-borne microorganisms of the genera Babesia, Hepatozoon,
   Rickettsia, Borrelia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia, and Coxiella; no tick
   specimen was found infected by any of these microorganism genera. The
   current study expands northwards the distribution of O. mimon, which has
   been shown to be very harmful to humans because of the intense
   inflammatory response that usually occurs after tick bites.},

Abstract = {The taeniosis-cysticercosis complex is an important disease to the
   public and animal health. The man plays an important role in the life
   cycle, because he is the unique definitive host. The adult forms of the
   Taenia solium or Taenia saginata holds in gut, and the larvae forms
   develops in the muscle of bovine and swine, respectively. The objective
   of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors of the
   taeniosis-cysticercosis complex transmission in rural area of Matias
   Barbosa - MG, Brazil. Catla and swine lood and human stool samples were
   collected from 74 farms. Cysticercosis were eniasis were diagnosis
   serological methods and the teniasis by direct microscopy. Moreover, a
   questionnaire was applied about the sanitary conditions of the animals
   and people envolved, food habits and housing. This research indicated
   the prevalence of 0,9 \% of cysticercosis bovine in the rural area of
   Matias Barbosa. Cases of cysticercosis swine and taeniosis were not
   found. Some risk factors for taeniosis-cysticercosis complex
   transmission in the municipality were identified and discussed. Despite
   the low predominance of bovine cysticercosis found in Matias Barbosa, it
   is necessary to maintain measures to control the taeniosis-cysticercosis
   complex to prevent causing increased cases of the zoonosis, considering
   that some risk factors favorable to their emergence were found.},

Title = {Towards more sustainable social housing projects: Recognizing the
   importance of using local resources},
Journal = {BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {The social housing projects of Brazil are focused on providing shelter
   for families with low income and on reaching the ultimate objective of
   more sustainable development of the nation. The Brazilian program, in
   supporting these families, is carried out through three main
   standardized housing projects: popular housing (R1), popular building
   (PP4), and building for social interest (PIS). Decisions regarding the
   choice of one project instead of another are usually based on economic
   considerations, disregarding environmental issues important for
   achieving sustainable development. The main goal of this work is to
   assess which social housing projects should be promoted in each
   Brazilian state, aiming for higher sustainability. For this purpose,
   emergy accounting is used to quantify the environmental sustainability
   index (ESI{*}) and the emergy index for construction productivity (EICP,
   in m(2)/sej). Results show the existence of different degrees of ESI{*}
   and EICP values among the three types of social housing projects, when
   considering the state in which projects are implemented. Analysis of the
   results identified the social housing projects that should be promoted
   to maximize ESI{*} and EICP aiming for higher sustainability. Choosing a
   project exclusively based on economic considerations could be premature,
   because it may forgo the opportunity to maximize sustainability of the
   national social housing program. This study also provides a scientific
   contribution to the emergy accounting method with regard to the scales
   of analysis that support the criteria used to count a resource as local
   or imported and in considering the partial renewabilities of resources
   according to regional characteristics.},

Title = {Comparative cost-benefit analysis of the energy efficiency measures and
   photovoltaic generation in houses of social interest in Brazil},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {243},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {There are two approaches to the issue of energy demand in buildings:
   generating more energy in a clean and renewable way or reducing the
   energy consumption of buildings through energy efficiency strate-gies.
   The question addressed by the article is how far to go with energy
   conservation and cost-effective measures. In this context, the general
   objective is to compare energy consumption and photo-voltaic generation
   distributed in single-family homes of interest, through the cost-benefit
   ratio. 576 mod -els were evaluated and the economic evaluation made for
   the model with the highest efficiency and the model with the lowest
   cost. The assessment was carried out using the Net Present Value (NPV),
   Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and the payback. NPV has not proved to be
   profitable to efficiency strategies in three scenarios. The only
   scenario with positive NPV was the scenario in which the interest rate
   is low and the increase in energy is high. In the case of the
   photovoltaic system, only one scenario did not demonstrate viability,
   the scenario with high-interest rates, and a low increase in the price
   of energy. The same applies to the IRR. With this research it is
   concluded that, when treated as competitors from the financial point of
   view, the photovoltaic system presents a better performance in the
   indicators, being the most convenient for isolated application.
   Answering the question raised and showing the possibility of cost
   benefit for a massive implementation of renewable, financially viable
   clean energy.

Title = {Material flow analysis of the residential building stock at the city of
   Rio de Janeiro},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {149},
Pages = {1249-1267},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {The extensive use of materials in building stocks contributes to the
   scarcity of natural resources and impacts from construction and
   demolition waste (CDW). Therefore, the concern with the efficient use of
   materials and CDW management made several countries conducted mapping,
   analysis and performance improvement in activities related to CDW using
   Material Flow Analysis (MFA). The city of Rio de Janeiro had a high
   urban development and building stock growth from the beginning of the
   last century, in which the amount of material consumed has not been
   documented. This study presents an MFA approach to assess the materials
   in-use and further flows of CDW from the residential building stock in
   the city of Rio de Janeiro. The material in-use was estimated from the
   extrapolation of the Material Intensities (MI) per different building
   types to the total constructed area in this city considering land
   occupation. The building types were modelled from the designs of typical
   buildings in Brazil. An analysis of urban development supported the
   estimation of buildings age and their remaining lifetime while national
   standards supported the time of replacement of building elements during
   the use phase. Results show that the stock in 2010 had about 78,828,770t
   of building material with MI between 2.58 and 0.74 t/m(2); concrete and
   aggregates have the higher MI. The Use phase of the buildings will move
   about 9,807,690t of materials until 2090. These findings support further
   environmental impacts assessments and decision-making for planning CDW
   management and strategies for the efficient use of materials. (C) 2017

Title = {Optimization of tank and flat-plate collector of solar water heating

Abstract = {Solar water heating systems are widely used in Brazil for domestic
   purposes in single-family households. The exploitation of the potential
   energy of the water from the upper tank and the thermosyphon phenomena
   for hot water circulation constitutes the absolute majority of the
   residential solar water heating systems in the country. But, these water
   heating systems are usually sized according to tables provided by the
   manufacturers, which show the number of plates required based on the
   size of the family and the number of hot water outlets. This sizing is
   based much more on intuition rather than on scientific data. For that
   reason, this work has developed an optimization model for water heating
   systems design parameters, using a numerical simulation routine, in a
   long-term transient regime. The optimized design gives the slope and
   area of the flat plate collector, which results in the minimum cost over
   the equipment life cycle. The computing procedure was executed
   considering specific characteristics of the project. A thermosyphon
   solar water heating system with flat-plate collector for Sao Paulo's
   climate was simulated. The practice of Brazilian designers and
   manufacturers is to recommend the maximization of the energetic gain for
   the winter. This paper has analyzed in economic terms if it is more
   attractive to increase the gain of solar energy in the winter period,
   with the consequence of reduction of the solar energy gain along the
   year, or to adopt the adequate slope, which improves the yearly solar
   energy gain. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Background: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection with high
   re-emergence rates in some Amazon regions. The main vectors of
   Trypanosoma cruzi are haematophagous insects, the triatomines. Only a
   few reports are available about the occurrence of these wild vectors and
   their contact with the inhabitants of the riverside regions of the
   Amazon. This study describes the unusual behaviour of the triatomines
   that have invaded the homes of the residents of Abaetetuba, the city
   that has the second highest number of cases of Chagas disease.
   Methods: Two cross-sectional studies were conducted using
   sero-epidemiological surveys of the inhabitants of Abaetetuba with
   registered triatomine home invasions. The frequencies of the variables
   of interestwere analysed using Epi Info version 7.2.
   Results: In 2014 and 2017, 145 persons registered home invasions of
   triatomines in their domiciles and 16.55\% reported having been bitten
   by insects. The environmental features described indicated potential
   conditions for the persistence of the parasite's life cycle. Of the
   enrolled inhabitants, 0.47\% were positive for immunoglobulin G anti-T.
   cruzi antibodies.
   Conclusions: Home invasions of triatomines were confirmed in two
   periods, with a description of unusual behaviour for the genus Rhodnius.
   The use of serological surveillance in human populations at risk of this
   occurrence may constitute a new tool for the early detection of silent
   infections.},

Abstract = {Waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is an expression used
   to refer to several pieces of equipment that are no longer valuable for
   their owners. This study evaluated the WEEE generation in a private
   higher education institution, located in the state of Rio Grande do Sul,
   Brazil. In this study, we used data from electrical and electronic
   equipment (EEE) available in the university information system, which
   amounted 51.066 items during 17 years. The main WEEE generated by the
   institution was Information technology (IT) and telecommunications
   equipment (48.2\%), followed by large household appliances (14.4\%),
   monitoring and control instruments (13.3\%), electrical and electronic
   tools (10.9\%) and consumer equipment (9.8\%). Over 414 EEE classes were
   identified in the institution, although, except for monitoring and
   control instruments, the 2 main EEEs in each class correspond to at
   least 50\% of its categories. In addition, it was noticed that the
   majority of WEEE was generated by the university administration
   (29.3\%), followed by the computer classrooms (17.3\%). These two areas
   feature low life EEEs, while other areas like Biology and Exact
   Sciences, due to the high number of analytics equipment used, have EEEs
   with longer life cycle, resulting in smaller waste generation. All these
   characteristics result in a great complexity in WEEE management in
   higher education institutions, mostly due to the considerable diversity,
   increasing the recycling complexity.},

Abstract = {This paper establishes a basis of research on the relationship between
   poverty, resources distribution and assets markets operation. The main
   objective is to help the implementation of capital enhancing policies
   towards the poor. The strategy followed is to analyze three different
   types of impacts that increasing the assets of the poor may have on
   social welfare. The first part of the paper evaluates the possession of
   different types of capital along the income distribution. This exercise
   can be perceived as an augmentation of income based poverty measures by
   incorporating the direct effect exerted by asset holdings on social
   welfare.
   The second part of the paper describes the income generating impact that
   asset holdings may have on poverty. It studies how the accumulation of
   different types of capital impact income-based poverty outcomes using
   logistic regressions.
   The third part studies the effect that increasing asset holdings of the
   poor has on improving poor individuals ability in dealing with adverse
   income shocks. This consist in studying the interaction between earnings
   dynamics, capital market imperfections and financial. behavior taking
   into account different time horizons. Long-run issues are related to the
   study of low frequency income fluctuations and life-cycle assets
   holdings using cohort analysis. Short-run issues are related to
   assessing the poor behavior and welfare losses in dealing with high
   frequency gaps between income and desired consumption. The analysis
   earnings and poverty dinamics in conducted with panel data while
   qualitative data is used for the analysis of household short-run
   financial behavior.},

Abstract = {This work assesses the electricity consumption profile of domestic solar
   hot water systems (DSHWS) and analyses, at high measurement-time
   resolutions for the first time, their economic viability in popular
   housing projects in Brazil. It analyses the impacts of the active power
   demand measurement-time resolution on the financial attractiveness of
   DSHWS. The predominance of a late-evening profile of electricity
   consumption for showering, coinciding with distribution utilities' peak
   demand hours, leads to over 40\% avoided active power during peak hours
   per consumer unit when adopting DSHWS. There is potential to finance
   DSHWS in popular housing with very favourable conditions for the
   distribution utility. For discount rates ranging from 0 to 9.5\%,
   payback times ranged between less than four and five years, NPV between
   \$ 2,191 and \$ 782, and IRR between 25\% and 14\%. The measurement of
   power demand at 15-min intervals, widely adopted by distribution
   utilities, is not adequate to properly evaluate the financial
   attractiveness of DSHWS, resulting in pessimistic financial analyses of
   the return on investment. The low load-factor of electric showerheads
   used in >90\% of Brazilian households, leads to the accounting of only
   37\% of the real avoided cost of adopting DSHWS when measuring power
   demand in 15-min intervals. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Worldwide the construction industry presents a significant demand for
   new technologies ensuring certainty, cost-effectiveness and time
   efficiency. Modern construction relies on digital resources, and one of
   the most prominent novelties is Building Information Modelling (BIM).
   Construction planning effectiveness is based on clear communication and
   integration between project planners and other participants, such as
   engineers, architects, suppliers, and workforce. The possible connection
   between 3 D models and time or scheduling potentially reduces
   misconception risks and lack of information to avoid re-scheduling and
   project delivery delays. This study aims to investigate the integration
   of Revit, Navisworks, Tally and Green Building Studio for identifying
   the challenges in applying 4 D BIM technology using a case study in a
   developing country (Brazil). The research method used comprised these
   steps: objectives definition, literature review, development of the 4 D
   analysis and evaluation, case study for validation with comparison to
   other comparable and contrasting studies, and discussion of the results.
   This paper demonstrates the feasibility and challenges to adopt BIM
   technology to thrive better communication for teams and stakeholders
   through the various construction stages via visual representation.
   Additionally, despite the obstacles and difficulties to integrate
   different software, it is beneficial to the decision-makers, not only
   focus on the constructability perspective but project's environmental
   impacts, such as energy efficiency and global warming effect.},

Abstract = {SMEs are crucial for economic health in both high and low-income
   economies worldwide. In Brazil, they are responsible for around 50\% of
   the national GDP. However, SMEs face considerable barriers such as
   difficulties in financing international activity, identifying
   opportunities and making appropriate contacts in their target markets.
   This paper investigates the adherence of both lean and green practices
   for the development of new products (NPD), as means to improve their
   efficiency (lean perspective) and manufacture environment-friendly
   products (green perspective). Through a systemic review, we present 16
   lean and green enablers for NPD operations. These elements comprise a
   structure of building blocks to evaluate lean and green practices. Thus,
   we propose a model that ranks the incidence of these practices
   regardless of the NPD organization level. Using two MCDM tools: AHP and
   fuzzy-TOPSIS, each enabler is evaluated considering the SMEs context in
   Brazil. Firstly, AHP defines the relative importance of six SMEs'
   characteristics. Secondly, we applied an expansion of the TOPSIS
   technique, adequate when the values of each alternative are not clearly
   determined. Therefore, we organized a structured interview consisting of
   96 evaluation questions for NPD stakeholders. We carried out this
   diagnosis in three companies from southern Brazil, analysing their NPD
   operations, which is useful to establish a future improvement agenda.},

Title = {An approach to investigate the interface between built environment and
   thermosyphon solar water heating system},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {223},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Several studies have already highlighted the benefits associated with
   the use of Solar Water Heating Systems (SWHS). Although this technology
   is already consolidated, there is a lack of studies regarding the
   impacts of its interaction with the user and the built environment.
   Thus, this work presents a multiparametric sensitivity analysis applied
   to identify and quantify the constructive and operational parameters
   that sensitize the SWHS performance indicators. This study was carried
   out at the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, using computer simulation in the
   EnergyPlus software. The model was validated presenting an average error
   of 7.5\%. The collector orientation proved to be the most critical
   constructive limitation for the SWHS performance. The divergence in the
   electric power consumption due to distinct orientations reached 60\%.
   Lower flat plate collector inclination (i=20 degrees) favors lower
   energy consumption during winter for some critical orientations. The
   constructive parameters V-st/A(col) ratio and tank volume affect
   significatively the performance of indicators providing saving of even
   284 kWh/year and increasing the tank temperature up to 15 degrees C.
   Changes on showering time may provide an increase of even 170 kWh/year
   in the useful energy gain. The results indicate that adequate
   adjustments in the parameters settings compensate or minimize the
   effects of constructive limitations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {This paper presents a methodology that uses the Monte Carlo Method (MCM)
   to estimate the behavior of economic parameters which may help decision,
   considering the risk in project sustainability. In order to show how
   this methodology can be used, a Grid-Connected Photovoltaic System
   (GCPVS) of 1.575 kWp, located on the roof top of the laboratory building
   of the Grupo de Estudos e Desenvolvimento de Alternativas Energeticas -
   GEDAE, at the Universidade Federal do Para - UFPA, Belem - Para -
   Brazil, and operating since December 2007, is analyzed. This system was
   chosen because it was the first GCPVS installed in the Brazilian Amazon
   Region, being the first risk evaluation on using a renewable energy
   source connected to the grid in the Region. This work also presents a
   similar treatment for the case of a stand-alone photovoltaic system
   (SAPVS) installed in the remote Santo Antonio Village, municipality of
   Breves, Para, Brazil, considering the risk of investment assumed by an
   investor in power generation projects with similar characteristics or
   using other renewable energy sources. The last case allows a better
   assessment for other important applications of renewable energy in the
   Amazon Region, where the demand for energy is growing, but is still
   costly and often not a priority in government actions. (C) 2014 Elsevier

   colonists in the Amazon have been associated with the dynamics of land
   use and land cover as well as the ability of combining distinct sources
   of income and welfare. However, few studies have discussed theoretically
   how these changes co-evolve, over distinct stages of frontier
   development and for the same colonist cohort, with the composition and
   size of farm households. This paper, based on the revision of the extant
   literature, proposes a Demo-livelihoods theoretical framework that
   combines and synthetizes three theoretical approaches - the household
   and land use life cycle approach, the livelihoods and capabilities
   approach, and the revisited theory of multiphasic responses. The
   objective is to provide theoretical groundings for empirical studies
   that unveil how microdemographics (individual and farm household) cohort
   dynamics in frontier settings such as the Amazon mediate livelihoods
   (including land use) strategies over distinct development stages. It
   shows how demographic factors may be significant to define livelihoods
   at earlier frontier stages and release explanatory power at later
   stages, when market integration increases and households increasingly
   adopt diversified livelihoods. Furthermore, demographic dynamics at each
   frontier stage may be associated with distinct livelihood strategies,
   including mobility, land use, and deforestation, and thus define the
   extent and nature of settler ` s welfare and food security.},

Abstract = {The avian life cycle is composed by a progressive sequence of life
   history stages (LHS). Changes in energy expenditure and exposure to
   stressors at different LHS require corresponding changes in behavior,
   physiology, and morphology. Variation in hematological parameters, such
   hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), and heterophil to lymphocyte ratio
   (H/L ratio), can have permissive, stimulatory, and preparative actions
   to help maintain homeostasis through different LHS. Few studies have
   examined differences in these parameters among different LHS in
   free-living birds, with most of them restricted to temperate zones. We
   collected blood samples and measured hematological parameters every week
   for over a year from a population of a common resident bird species in
   southeastern Brazil, the pale-breasted thrush Turdus leucomelas.
   Hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration were highest during the onset of
   the reproduction and lowest during molt. Furthermore, H/L ratios were
   higher at the end of the reproduction, indicating that the breeding
   season could be the most stressful period of the year for this
   population of thrushes. There was no difference between sexes for any
   hematological parameter at any LHS. These results show that there is a
   permissive physiological effect for Hct and Hb to facilitate LHS
   transitions and that reproduction could be the most stressful event for
   this species. Lastly, these results mirror those from temperate species
   despite distinct environmental differences between these regions.},

Abstract = {In this study, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass
   spectrometry was used to characterize the growth patterns of otolith of
   Micropogonias furnieri from southeastern Brazil under the influence of
   coastal marine upwelling. Archaeological fish sagittae otoliths of M.
   furnieri recovered from Brazilian shell mounds (5820-4980 cal BP) were
   analysed and compared with those of modern specimens. Otolith Sr/Ca
   analysis indicated that off southeastern Brazil, M. furnieri shifted
   from freshwater/brackish in archaeological specimens to brackish/marine
   in modern times. Regular core-to-edge Sr/Ca oscillations suggest that
   both modern and archaeological M. furnieri are resident estuarine fish
   that also use the marine waters adjacent to the coastal zone. Based on
   analyses of a wide range of otolith edge Sr/Ca values measured in
   archaeological samples, pre-colonial fishing activities in the coastal
   regions of Guanabara Bay occurred throughout the year. This study
   reinforces the importance of M. furnieri as a precolonial fishing
   resource in this area and demonstrates a shift in fishing practices,
   where smaller fish are targetted within the bay and larger fish are
   caught beyond the bay. These data may also be indicative of a shift in
   the life cycle of this species, possibly caused by the overfishing of
   this important resource and significant increase in human activities in
   protected coastal waters in modern times.},

Pages = {211-225},
Abstract = {The high populational density and poor or absent waste management
   strategies in developing economies make the deployment of
   waste-to-energy techniques a feasible strategy. A large portion of the
   Brazilian household domestic waste, for example, is inadequately
   destined, generating impacts on soils, water resources and increased
   emissions of greenhouse gases. Currently, Brazil produces around 1.83
   billion cubic meters of biogas per year, but its full potential is yet
   to be explored totally. The country can minimize its energy
   vulnerability and increase the sustainability of its energy production
   by applying circular economy principles and waste-to-energy. This
   chapter seeks to unravel the potential for biogas production from
   household organic waste in Brazil, presenting an assessment of the
   potential of energy generation from Municipal Solid Waste and the
   promising localizations for implementing biogas plants. As a result, the
   country's potential for renewable methane amounts to about 9 MM
   m(3)/day. The coastal and southeastern areas have a larger potential to
   convert household waste into energy due to the higher population
   concentration. The latter can also increase the energy production
   reliability in the northeastern and southeastern regions, supporting
   operators to circumvent seasonally renewable sources. The scenario for
   biogas in Brazil is positive. However, the country still needs
   consolidation of its public policies to incentivize the biogas insertion
   into its energy matrix and entrepreneurship toward the smarter handling
   of wastes.},

Title = {Did the animal move? A cross-wavelet approach to geolocation data
   reveals year-round whereabouts of a resident seabird},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Considerable progress in our understanding of long-distance migration
   has been achieved thanks to the use of small geolocator devices (GLS).
   The tracking of resident or short-distance migrant animals remains
   however challenging because geolocation errors are substantial and
   difficult to estimate. This study aims to examine the sex-specific
   marine space uses of a resident tropical seabird, the masked booby (Sula
   dactylatra), during its full annual life cycle at the Fernando de
   Noronha archipelago (Brazil). Masked boobies (n = 31) tagged with GLS
   recording light intensity, seawater immersion, and water temperature
   showed a resident behaviour over their entire annual cycle. A wavelet
   analysis of GLS data revealed oscillatory patterns of inferred longitude
   correlated with changes in immersion frequency. This synchronicity
   demonstrated that birds traveled away and back from the colony on
   consecutive trips of short length (similar to 2-4 days) and short range
   (similar to 100-300 km) eastward of the colony. Duration and range of
   trips depended on the sex of the individual and on the time of the year.
   Trip duration increased gradually from the end of the breeding period to
   the post-breeding period, probably due to the release of the
   central-place breeding constraints. During the pre-breeding period,
   females had farther ranges eastward and spent more time in water than
   males. Despite inherent limits of light-based geolocation, this study
   demonstrates the relevance of synchronicity analysis of GLS data for
   investigating year-round movements of resident or short-distance
   migrants.},

Abstract = {The life cycle of vectors and the reservoirs that participate in the
   chain of infectious diseases have a strong relationship with the
   environmental dynamics of the ecosystems in which they live.
   Oscillations in population abundance and seasonality of insects can be
   explained by factors inherent in each region and time period. Therefore,
   knowledge of the relationship and influence of environmental factors on
   the population of Lutzomyia longipalpis is necessary because of the high
   incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Brazil. This study evaluates
   the influence of abiotic variables on the population density and
   seasonal behavior of L. longipalpis in an urban endemic area of VL in
   Brazil. The sand fly captures were performed every two months between
   November, 2009 and November, 2010 in the peridomicile of 13 randomly
   selected residences. We captured 1,367 specimens of L. longipalpis, and
   the ratio of male/female flies was 2.86:1. The comparison of the total
   male specimens in the two seasons showed a statistical difference in the
   wet season, but there was no significant difference when considering the
   total females. With respect to climatic variables, a significant
   negative association was observed only with wind speed. During periods
   of high wind speeds, the population density of this vector decreased.
   The presence of L. longipalpis was found in all months of the study with
   bimodal behavior and population peaks during the wet season.},

Title = {Structure for the classification of disassembly applied to BIM models.},

Abstract = {To consider disassembly from project inception is becoming an essential
   part of the design process. This approach enables the reuse and
   recycling of materials at the end of the life cycle of buildings,
   reducing the need for raw materials to produce new products whilst
   increasing a building's flexibility during any potential
   reconfiguration. Above all, disassembly contributes to sustainability
   within the sector. Little is known however about designing for future
   disassembly. In general, the design phase of construction projects tends
   to focus efforts on constructability, with the value of disassembly only
   becoming apparent during the decommissioning of a building. The
   construction sector is unfamiliar with the disassembly approach and the
   comprehensive information management process, linking design and
   decommissioning for over 60 years. Regarding this, advances in Building
   Information Modelling (BIM) research offer opportunities for further
   developing the field of design for disassembly (DfD) in construction
   projects. Addressing this knowledge gap, this research explores the
   structuring of DfD information enabled by BIM to support integrated
   design decision-making in construction. This applied research project is
   inherently exploratory and based on design science research. DfD
   principles were identified through a literature review. Primary data was
   collected through case-study research, informing the development of an
   integrated DfD information model for measuring disassembly levels,
   restricted to the most common materials and construction systems used in
   Brazil. This research presents both a contribution to practice, by
   developing an information model structure to support DfD and integrated
   design, also to DfD knowledge by proposing a disassembly classification
   system.},

Title = {Enhancing Healthcare Infrastructure: A Comprehensive Approach for
   Building Performance Evaluation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {39},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {In Brazil, healthcare buildings are acknowledged for their architectural
   complexity, because they are designed to cater to a heterogeneous and
   vulnerable public. Building performance assessments (BPEs) offer an
   alternative means to comprehend the authentic state of these structures
   and to identify potential enhancements. However, due to the
   multidisciplinary nature of healthcare buildings, the BPE process can be
   both extensive and intricate. Consequently, this research developed a
   systematic approach to BPE in healthcare by delineating and categorizing
   pertinent themes that are integral to the evaluation process. To achieve
   this objective, the research encompassed three distinct parts: (1)
   elaboration of the initial proposal for a BPE approach for healthcare
   buildings; (2) validation of identified themes and their organizational
   structure through the application of the Delphi method; and (3)
   conversion of the generated proposal into a quantitative approach with
   factors and weights for each dimension of the Healthcare BPE approach
   developed. The outcome of this rigorous process yielded a conceptual
   framework for Healthcare BPE comprising 6 dimensions, 25 criteria, and
   201 subcriteria. These dimensions range from considerations of location
   to comfort, encompassing environmental and social issues. Additionally,
   the criteria were related systematically to distinct phases within the
   building's life cycle. This research effort resulted in the proposal of
   a Healthcare BPE approach that is capable of addressing critical
   concerns, aligned with either the various phases of the building or
   specific requirements. This structured and comprehensive approach will
   enhance the effectiveness of BPE in the context of healthcare buildings,
   providing a valuable tool for stakeholders involved in their design,
   construction, and ongoing management.},

Title = {Organophosphate esters in inert landfill soil: A case study},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT \& RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {42},
Number = {7},
Pages = {583-590},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Organophosphate esters (OPEs) used as flame retardants and plasticizers
   are additives in building and construction materials, decorations,
   furniture, electronic equipment, among other applications. The presence
   of materials containing these substances in construction and demolition
   waste (CDW) from weak waste management practices can result in
   environmental contamination. In this study, OPEs' presence in soil
   samples collected from a CDW landfill in Brazil was evaluated. Soil
   samples were collected in areas adjacent to CDW from an inert landfill,
   and the samples were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass
   spectrometry. The OPEs were detected in all soil samples at quantifiable
   concentrations ranging from 21 to 251 ng g-1, and detected compounds
   were tris(phenyl) phosphate, tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate,
   tris(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate, tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate
   and 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate. The presence of these compounds in
   a CDW landfill is probably due to the lack of control of the materials
   sent to and deposited in the landfill, which, results in part from the
   lack of sampling and screening systems that can help identify the
   presence of contaminants in the CDW waste stream. This is partially due
   to OPEs not being considered controlled compounds under current
   regulations, thus screening or separation for handling of OPEs at
   construction and demolition work sites is rare to non-existent. The data
   generated in this study reveals the need for improving CDW management to
   minimize, if not eliminate, environmental contamination by OPEs.},

Abstract = {The lack of usable aggregates for civil construction in Rio Branco
   (capital of Acre, a Federal State in the Amazon region) makes the
   production and use of recycled aggregates from construction and
   demolition waste (CDW) an alternative of great interest. In this study,
   a comprehensive characterization of CDW collected from 24 construction
   sites of six building types and three different construction phases
   (structures, masonry, and finishing) was carried out. The fine and
   coarse recycled aggregates were produced and evaluated in 10 different
   compositions. The aggregates' performance was evaluated in four mixtures
   designed for laying and coating mortars with a total replacement of
   conventional aggregates and a mixture designed for a C25 concrete with
   50\% and 100\% replacement of conventional aggregates. CDW mortars
   showed lower densities and greater water retention, initial adhesion,
   and mechanical strength than conventional mortars. CDW concretes
   presented lower densities and greater resistance to chloride penetration
   than conventional concrete, with a small mechanical strength reduction.
   The recycled CDW aggregates proved to be technologically feasible for
   safe application in mortars and concrete; for this reason, it is
   believed that the alternative and proposed methodology is of great
   interest to the Amazonian construction industry, considering the high
   costs of raw materials and the need for defining and consolidating a
   sustainable development model for the Amazon region.},

Abstract = {This study empirically explores the Quadruple Helix model's potential in
   facilitating an urgent open innovation project. By examining the life
   cycle of the project, developed during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis in
   Brazil, it reveals complex interactions among government, academia,
   industry, and civil society stakeholders, while also shedding light on
   the various risks arising from their dynamic collaboration. Employing an
   approach that combines case study analysis, risk assessment, and
   theoretical framework development, we unravel the project's evolution,
   highlighting pivotal elements such as trust, collaboration,
   communication, agile mindset, stakeholder partnerships, scale, and
   logistics. Additionally, the study underscores concerns related to
   finance, time, reputation, and health, which warrant consideration. Risk
   analysis uncovers internal and external risks and categorizes thirty-two
   risks, with one deemed unacceptable, thus revealing valuable insights
   into stakeholders' partnerships, institutional image, public equipment,
   manufacturing, project management, human resources, intellectual
   property, regulation, and sanitation risks. Building on these findings,
   we develop a new framework illustrating the management of the urgent
   open innovation project through the fast-paced Quadruple Helix
   formation. By exploring stakeholder collaboration and risk management,
   this research provides insights into the adaptability and speed required
   to successfully execute an emergency project, as well as presenting
   practical strategies for risk management and mitigation, significantly
   contributing to the domains of the Quadruple Helix and project
   management research.},

Title = {First evidence of wasp brood development inside active nests of a

Abstract = {Potter wasps (Vespidae: Eumeninae) are known to exhibit not only
   sophisticated preying strategies but also a remarkable ability to
   manipulate clay during nest building. Due to a mixture of plasticity in
   building behavior and flexibility in substrate preferences during nest
   building, the group has been reported nesting in a variety of places,
   including decaying nests abandoned by termite species. Yet, evidence of
   wasps nesting inside senescent termite mounds is poorly reported, and to
   date, accounts confirming their presence inside active colonies of
   termites are absent. Here, we address a novel intriguing association
   between two species from the Brazilian Cerrado: a previously unknown
   potter wasp (nest invader) and a termite species (nest builder). Besides
   scientifically describingMontezumia termitophilasp. nov. (Vespidae:
   Eumeninae), named after its association with the termiteConstrictotermes
   cyphergaster(Silvestri, 1901) (Termitidae: Nasutitermitinae), we provide
   preliminary information about the new species' bionomics by including
   (a) a hypothetical life cycle based on the evidence we collected and (b)
   a footage showing the first interaction between a recently ecloded wasp
   and a group of termites. In doing so, we attempt to provoke relevant
   discussions in the field and, perhaps, motivate further studies with the
   group. Finally, we describe a solution to efficiently detect and sample
   termitophilous species from termite nests, an intrinsic yet challenging
   task of any studies dealing with such a cryptic biological system.},

Title = {Eco-design of airborne sound insulation in Recycled Lightweight Concrete
   walls for Brazilian social housing: A reliability-based approach},
Journal = {APPLIED ACOUSTICS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {230},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {In Brazil, normal strength concrete (NSC) and steel bars are commonly
   used to construct residential buildings with concrete walls. However,
   recent discussions have highlighted the environmental impact of these
   traditional methods, particularly in terms of carbon footprint and the
   use of virgin materials. In response, alternative materials such as
   lightweight recycled coarse aggregates are promising. While Eco-design
   often focuses on structural and material aspects, acoustic efficiency is
   often neglected. This paper focuses on the airborne sound insulation of
   a single-story house in a Brazilian housing program constructed using a
   concrete wall system made of NSC. An accurate experimental validation
   was carried out in this house, recording a measured and simulated
   Weighted Standardized Level Difference ( ,) of 50 dB for a partition
   wall between two living rooms, outperforming the national standard
   requirement of 40 dB. With the simulation data validated, an innovative
   assessment using reliability methods was proposed to analyze the
   sensitivity of the problem in terms of the main variables, using three
   alternative wall materials: NSC, Lightweight Concrete (LC) and Recycled
   Lightweight Concrete (RLC). A sensitivity analysis using Sobol's indices
   identified wall thickness, density, and Young's modulus as the most
   critical input parameters to the model. Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) was
   used to calculate the failure probability of each assumed thickness, and
   Reliability-Based Design Optimization (RBDO) was used to determine the
   optimum thickness to meet the standard requirement. Through RBDO, we
   determined optimal wall thicknesses for the concrete mixes studied,
   aiming at a sound reduction index () of 43 dB, following the Brazilian
   standard ABNT NBR 15575-4 and ISO 12354-1. The optimal thicknesses were
   7.3 cm for NSC, 11.15 cm for LC, and 10.27 cm for RLC. Innovative
   acoustic-carbon efficiency indices are proposed to evaluate the studied
   materials: the Carbon-Acoustic Efficiency Index (CAEi) and the
   Recyclability-Acoustic-Carbon Efficiency Index (RACEi), which are used
   for a comprehensive assessment of both sustainability and acoustic
   performance between materials. Using these indices, the study shows that
   RLC can definitively replace NSC for airborne sound insulation, offering
   additional environmental benefits such as recyclability.},

Abstract = {The traditional paradigm of civil construction design process has been
   characterised predominantly by linear logic with the absence of any
   integration among the different parts that constitute the life cycle of
   an enterprise. This scenerio begins at the design stage, resulting from
   the neglect of its management, in such a way that planning and
   controlling are replaced by chaos and improvisation. Many design-related
   deficiencies are due to the lack of communication among designers and
   little collaboration from the involved agents. As a response for this
   situation, the principles of Concurrent Engineering and of Design for
   Excellence (DFE) methods should be taken into consideration. DFE
   includes Design for Maintenance (DFM) practices, which are currently a
   relevant subject for the building sector, as buildings are expected to
   last for decades and the necessity of adaptation throughout their
   operational lives (including the reduction of energy consumption and
   bioclimatic demands) is very clear. Considering that maintenance
   includes several different factors and agents, this research aims to
   provide guidelines for occupational safety at heights during the
   maintenance stage of an enterprise, hoping to avoid accidents at the
   workplace-which is an important matter in the contemporary Brazilian
   context. For this purpose, a bibliographical revision was made from both
   national and international sources. As a result, we hope to contribute
   for the design process in the civil construction field. The diffusion of
   this subject's importance among the professionals in this field was
   perceived as necessary for an effective contribution to design
   practices, since these guidelines are not mandatory in the current
   legislation, although they would be a differential for the design
   process and the enterprise as a whole.},

Title = {Age structure and life cycles of the Argentine shortfin squid
   Illex argentinus (Cephalopoda: Ommastrephidae) in southern
   Brazil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {93},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Age structure and hatchling dates of the squid Illex argentinus
   collected by bottom-trawl fishery in southern Brazilian waters were
   assessed by the analysis of statolith growth increments. Catches
   occurred between 2001 and 2002, from 23 degrees to 32 degrees S at
   depths of 100-700 m. Squid from juvenile to post-spawning stages were
   collected year round, with age estimated from 98 to 320 days and mantle
   lengths ranging from 112 to 376 mm. Duration of life cycle events based
   on statolith growth zones revealed that squids can spend about 14\% of
   their lifespan as paralarva (similar to 30 days), 70\% as juvenile
   (similar to 130 days), leaving maturity and spawning condition to the
   terminal 10-20\% (similar to 30-60 days). The results suggest that,
   unlike estimates available for Patagonian populations, a general 0.5
   year lifespan is predicted for I. argentinus off Brazil. The wide range
   of size-at-ages implied that catches of shortfin squid off southern
   Brazil probably include squid hatched throughout the year. Mature and
   spawning squid caught in summer months hatched in winter and spring,
   while winter catches revealed mature-spawning individuals hatched both
   in summer/autumn (similar to 6 months of age) and winter/spring periods
   (similar to 10-11 months of age). It has been argued that such groups
   may combine both squid resident of Brazilian outer shelf and slope (22
   degrees-34 degrees S) with a six months' lifespan and migrating squid
   originated from the northern Patagonian shelf (similar to 42 degrees S)
   with 10-11 months' lifespan.},

Title = {Tungiasis: Participation of Cats and Chickens in the Dispersion and

Abstract = {Tunga spp. are fleas commonly found in impoverished tropical regions. In
   Vila Juerana, a tourist community in Ilheus, Bahia, Brazil, where
   tungiasis is endemic, dogs are the main host of fleas during their life
   cycle. However, there is no information about the role of cats and
   chickens in tungiasis in the village. Of the 272 households
   investigated, 112 had domestic animals, 48 had only dogs, 28 had only
   cats, and nine had only chickens. Of the 27 households with cohabitation
   among species, 16 had cats and dogs, eight had chickens and dogs, and
   three had dogs, cats, and chickens. The injuries due to tungiasis were
   ranked according to the Fortaleza classification, considering stages I,
   II, and III as viable lesions. The paws/feet of 71/111 (63.9\%) cats and
   173/439 (39.4\%) chickens were inspected. Dogs that lived with positive
   cats and chickens also were inspected. Among the 38\% (27/7; 95\% IC
   26.74-49.32) positive cats, 16 cohabited houses with infected dogs but
   none lived with positive chickens. Of the chickens, 2.3\% (4/173; 95\%
   IC 0.07-4.5) had lesions caused by tungiasis. In each household where a
   cat was infected, the dog was also positive. Two chickens cohabited with
   an infected dog and the other two did not coexist with other species.
   Cohabitation with infected dogs and the absence of house confinement
   restrictions in Vila Juerana make cats important carriers that spread
   tungiasis in this community. Chickens had a low frequency of tungiasis
   lesions despite living in proximity to infected dogs and cats.},

Abstract = {The life cycle of synanthropic flies and their behavior, allows them to
   serve as mechanical vectors of several pathogens. Given that flies can
   carry multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, this study aimed to
   investigate the spread of genes of antimicrobial resistance in
   Escherichia coli isolated from flies collected in two dairy farms in
   Brazil. Besides antimicrobial resistance determinants, the presence of
   virulence genes related to bovine colibacillosis was also assessed. Of
   94 flies collected, Musca domestica was the most frequently found in the
   two farms. We isolated 198 E. coli strains (farm A=135 and farm B=63),
   and >30\% were MDR E. coli. We found an association between bla(TEM) and
   phenotypical resistance to ampicillin, or chloramphenicol, or
   tetracycline; and bla(CTX-M) and resistance to cefoperazone. A high
   frequency (86\%) of phylogenetic group B1 among MDR strains and the lack
   of association between multidrug resistance and virulence factors
   suggest that antimicrobial resistance possibly is associated with the
   commensal bacteria. Clonal relatedness of MDR E. coli performed by
   Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis showed wide genomic diversity.
   Different flies can carry clones, but with distinct antimicrobial
   resistance pattern. Sanger sequencing showed that the same class 1
   integron arrangement is displayed by apparently unrelated strains,
   carried by different flies. Our conjugation results indicate class 1
   integron transfer associated with tetracycline resistance. We report for
   the first time, in Brazil, that MDR E. coli is carried by flies in the
   milking environment. Therefore, flies can act as carriers for MDR
   strains and contribute to dissemination routes of antimicrobial
   resistance. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {As building energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions rise
   globally, retrofitting existing structures offers a pathway toward more
   sustainable construction practices. However, balancing improvements to
   technical performance with financial constraints poses challenges.
   Specifically, whether coordinated implementation of energy retrofits and
   on-site photovoltaic generation provides synergistic benefits worthy of
   initial capital investment remains mostly unclear. To address this, the
   present study evaluates the economic and energy performance impacts of
   integrated retrofit and renewable energy integration strategies for a
   university building in Recife, Brazil. In this study, a calibrated
   building energy model simulated conservation measures and photovoltaic
   sizing under varying optimization objectives and sensitivities. The most
   significant contribution lies in its holistic, location-specific
   approach to achieving near-zero energy status within the educational
   facility through optimized retrofit strategies. This includes
   incorporating real-world metered energy data to calibrate the model and
   inform cost assessments, enhancing practical relevance. Tabu search
   optimization identified packages minimizing electricity usage intensity
   and life cycle costs over 25 years. Results indicate that integrating
   thermal modeling, economic analysis, and optimization identifies
   synergistic retrofits and photovoltaic sizing configurations reducing
   consumption by over 45 MWh/yr while improving net present value by more
   than \$170,000 relative to baseline performance without increased
   investment. Notably, Case 5 achieved 48.6 kWh/m2.yr intensity and
   \$412,978 net present value, reductions of 11\% and a 4\% increase,
   respectively, versus the baseline. Occupancy and HVAC emerged as
   impactful factors highlighting operational adjustment benefits. Findings
   support deep retrofits coordinated with on-site renewables as a pathway
   to cost-effectively decarbonize building stocks.},

Title = {Development and preliminary study of the rLiNTPDase2 rapid test: A
   lateral flow immunochromatographic assay for Canine Visceral
   Leishmaniasis},
Journal = {VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {331},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Canine Visceral Leishmaniasis (CVL) is the most fatal form of Leishmania
   infection in dogs and is caused by L. infantum in the Americas. This
   parasite follows a zoonotic life cycle, raising concerns within domestic
   households, where dogs act as the primary reservoir of the parasite.
   Accurately detecting infected dogs is vital for effective
   epidemiological control in both canine and human populations. However,
   existing diagnostic methods in Brazil have limitations, particularly in
   detecting asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic dogs, leading to ineffective
   disease control. To address this challenge, we evaluated a novel
   recombinant antigen from L. infantum, the rLiNTPDase2. Previous studies
   have confirmed its high performance via ELISA, leading us to assess its
   suitability for a Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Assay (LFIA), which
   is ideal for point-of-care testing. Standardization of the assay
   involved testing two nitrocellulose membranes (HF135 and HF120,
   Millipore), three blocking protocols, and five sample dilutions (1:10,
   1:20, 1:40, 1:80, and 1:160). Following the chosen conditions (HF120
   membrane, 1-minute blocking protocol, and 1:80 sample dilution), we
   validated our assay with a sample size of 78 dogs, comprising 32
   negatives and 46 positives, including symptomatic (n=23),
   oligosymptomatic (n=17), and asymptomatic (n=6) cases. The results
   revealed a sensitivity of 86.9 \%, specificity of 62.5 \%, and accuracy
   of 76.9 \%, which is consistent with ELISA performance for the same
   samples. Compared to DPP-LVC, our assay demonstrated promising results
   in detecting asymptomatic and oligosymptomatic cases. This study
   underscores the suitability of the rLiNTPDase2 antigen for the LFIA
   format, suggesting its potential as a novel point-of-care diagnostic
   test for CVL.},

Title = {The Influence of Parental Psychopathology on Offspring Suicidal Behavior
   across the Lifespan},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 31},
Abstract = {Suicide tends to occur in families, and parental psychopathology has
   been linked to offspring suicidal behaviors. This study explores the
   influence of parental mental disorders across the lifespan. Data are
   from the Sao Paulo Megacity Mental Health Survey, a cross-sectional
   household study with a representative sample of the adult population
   living in the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, Brazil (N=2,942). Survival
   models examined bivariate and multivariate associations between a range
   of parental disorders and offspring suicidality. After controlling for
   comorbidity, number of mental disorders and offspring psychopathology,
   we found that parental psychopathology influences suicidal behaviors
   throughout most part of the life cycle, from childhood until young adult
   years. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and antisocial personality
   were associated with offspring suicidal ideation (OR 1.8 and 1.9,
   respectively), panic and GAD predicted suicidal attempts (OR 2.3 and
   2.7, respectively), and panic was related to the transition from
   ideation to attempts (OR 2.7). Although noticed in many different stages
   of the lifespan, this influence is most evident during adolescence. In
   this period, depression and antisocial personality increased the odds of
   suicidal ideation (OR 5.1 and 3.2, respectively), and depression, panic
   disorder, GAD and substance abuse predicted suicidal attempts (OR
   varying from 1.7 to 3.8). In short, parental disorders characterized by
   impulsive-aggression and anxiety-agitation were the main predictors of
   offspring suicidality across the lifespan. This clinically relevant
   intergenerational transmission of suicide risk was independent of
   offspring mental disorders, and this underscores the need for a family
   approach to psychopathology.},

Title = {Population biology and secondary production of the harvested clam

Journal = {MARINE ECOLOGY-AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE},
Year = {2015},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The population structure, growth and production of the trigonal clam
   Tivela mactroides were investigated by monthly sampling between January
   2003 and October 2004 in two areas (southern and northern) of the
   intertidal and subtidal zones of Caraguatatuba Bay, Southeastern Brazil.
   Intertidal sampling was carried out in each area along eight transects
   perpendicular to the shoreline. In the subtidal zone of both areas, one
   50-m dredging was performed along five sampling stations arranged on
   three transects perpendicular to the coast. The intertidal abundance of
   T.mactroides was higher in the southern (more dissipative conditions)
   than in the northern area. High abundances occurred in February-March
   2004 in the south and in September 2004 in the north. The size structure
   showed that younger individuals dominated in the sublittoral, indicating
   that recruitment occurs in this zone, followed by the migration of these
   individuals to the intertidal, where they complete their life cycle.
   Tivela mactroides showed continuous reproduction, with 26 cohorts
   detected in the study period. The lower estimates for the growth index
   (phi=3.22), mortality rate (Z=2.10year(-1)) and turnover rate
   (P/B=1.21year(-1)), and conversely the longer life span (2.5years) of
   T.mactroides in Caraguatatuba Bay (24 degrees S) compared with
   Venezuelan populations (10 degrees N) suggests a latitudinal pattern of
   these life-history traits. The high production of T.mactroides in
   Caraguatatuba Bay was due to continuous recruitment and rapid and
   continuous growth, and demonstrates the importance of T.mactroides as a
   biological resource for many marine species and for the local residents.},

Abstract = {Austrolebias genus comprises about 40 small annual killifishes endemic
   to South America and their highest diversity occurs in southern Brazil
   and Uruguay, especially in drainages of Patos-Mirim system. Austrolebias
   species are severely threatened with extinction because their life cycle
   and restricted ranges. Low dispersal ability and the extensive loss and
   fragmentation of freshwater wetlands contribute to this threat. Accurate
   information on the geographic distribution and ecology of the species,
   vital to plan conservation and management strategies, are scarce. In
   order to provide basic knowledge for annual fish conservation this paper
   reports the presence of Austrolebias cheradophilus and present data
   about its population structure (CPUA, size, sex ratio, length-weight
   relationships and condition factor) and conservation status in southern
   Brazil. The estimated CPUA of populations was 0.86 fish/m(2). Standard
   length (SL) of males ranged between 32.14 and 49.17 mm and for females
   between 25.11 and 41.6 mm. There were no differences in SL between the
   sexes (t-test = - 1.678; P = 0.105), and Chi-squared test demonstrated
   marginal differences in proportions of sexes (2.25:1; chi 2 = 3.846; P =
   0.07). Allometric coefficient of the LWR was slightly hyperallometric (b
   = 3.08) and K of the specimens ranged from 1.84 to 2.42 (mean +/- S.E. =
   2.12 +/- 0.04). Populations have low density and their biotopes are
   under critical threat, mainly due to suppression by agriculture,
   pastures for livestock and increase housing. The species is considered
   ``Critically Endangered{''} in Brazil, furthermore is strongly
   recommended its inclusion on lists of endangered fauna and ensures the
   protection of their remaining habitats.},

   with the lowest indices during the rainy season. Malaria transmission is
   discussed in relation to 1) the physical structure of the town at the
   time it was jounded; 2) the streams that the urban area and their
   relation to the life cycle of the anophelines; 3) biting activity of the
   species collected in natural environments and areas altered by man; and
   4) the importance of environmental management for malaria control by
   reducing the vector population density. To reduce the penetration of
   urban areas by mosquitoes from from the surrounding countryside, a
   protective belt around the town is proposed. This belt should be of
   sparse forest and include alternative hosts to encourage the zoophilic
   tendencies of the anophelines. Infection rates among anophelines in
   areas authocthonous for malaria incriminate A. darlingi as a vector. The
   possibility of transmission by other species is discussed.},

Title = {GENETIC DIVERSITY OF Lutzomyia (Nyssomyia)
   intermedia IN AN ENDEMIC AREA OF AMERICAN CUTANEOUS

Abstract = {Lutzomyia intermedia (Diptera: Psychodidae) features as one of the main
   vectors that are involved in the transmission of American cutaneous
   leishmaniasis (ACL) in the Neotropical region. However, genetic studies
   involving this taxon are still incipient and important for understanding
   the level of variability of different populations, their role, and
   implications as vectors. The aim of this study was to determine the
   level of genetic diversity of L. intermedia present in the Ribeira River
   Valley, an area of ACL transmission in the state of Parana, Brazil,
   through the Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Two municipalities
   were chosen to collect sand flies: Cerro Azul (new transmission area of
   the ACL) and Adrianopolis (endemic area of the ACL). The insects were
   captured in the house, in the peridomicile and in the wild (forest). Two
   of the used markers made it possible to estimate the polymorphism of the
   studied populations, resulting in 40 genotypes, most of them from
   peridomicile. The dendrogram generated by the analysis with the primer
   A10 showed different degrees of similarity, suggesting that there may be
   gene flow in the studied populations. The Principal Coordinate Analysis
   (PCO) with the A2 primer, was useful in grouping L. intermedia according
   to its ecological and geographical origin. There was no distinction
   between the lineages composing the L. intermedia complex. The results of
   this study, with the record of great genotypic diversity in L.
   intermedia, may contribute to explain the maintenance of the life cycle
   of Leishmania braziliensis (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in the
   region.},

Abstract = {The structure and seasonal dynamics of larvae of the Gobiidae family in
   the Mucuri Estuary (Bahia, Brazil) were studied for nine consecutive
   years. Sampling was conducted at three stations in the lower estuary
   channel, between 2002 and 2010, in relation to season, day and night and
   tidal variations. A total of 5802 Gobiidae larvae, representing 15 taxa
   (12 species and three morphotypes), were collected in the Mucuri Estuary
   during this time. The highest mean +/- s.d. density of fish larvae, 54
   center dot 7 +/- 79 center dot 8 larvae 100 m(-3), was recorded during
   the flood tide and night sampling. Ctenogobius boleosoma was the most
   abundant species (68\%), being dominant in the rainy and dry seasons and
   had a long reproductive period. This species was classed as a marine
   estuarine-opportunist because it was observed at high frequencies and
   active larvae entering the estuary between 6 center dot 1 and 12 center
   dot 0 mm standard length (L-S). Gobionellus oceanicus, second in
   abundance (12\%), occurred only in later larval stages but did not use
   the estuary as a preferred location for spawning, being classed a marine
   estuarine dependent. Microgobius carri (11\%) was represented in all L-S
   classes and was resident in the estuary for spawning, remaining there
   throughout their life cycle. The other species were considered rare due
   to their low densities and could not be classified in any guild.},

Title = {Potential of carbon credits generation from organic waste composting of

   landfills},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS AMBIENTAIS},

Abstract = {This study aims to measure the potential for reducing Greenhouse Gases
   by surveying the amount of methane avoided by a company that collects
   and processes organic waste from large generators through composting.
   The applied methodology was the avoidance of methane emissions through
   composting, from the Clean Development Mechanism, considering as a
   baseline the emissions of the Santa Rosa sanitary landfill, located in
   the city of Seropedica, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. With data on
   the amount of organic waste composted by the company, the emissions of
   carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) were calculated, considering the
   standard emission factors established in the methodological instrument.
   The data show that the emission of 22,062 tons of CO2eq was avoided,
   which corresponds to a reduction of 83.5\% of CH4 emissions, if the
   waste composted by the company were deposited in the Santa Rosa sanitary
   landfill. In terms of carbon credit, according to the calculation, this
   value would correspond to approximately 17 thousand euros annually
   (considering current values). Thus, the applicability of this study
   contributes as a scientific basis to assist decision-making and
   effectiveness of other composting projects, enabling greater reductions
   in emissions of Greenhouse Gases in the long term and adequacy to the
   future perspectives of carbon market development. At the same time, it
   contributes to the construction of alternative scenarios for mitigation
   and reduction of Greenhouse Gases emissions in Brazil and promotes
   sustainable waste management, as determined by the National Solid Waste
   Policy.},

Title = {Integrating conventional and green roofs for mitigating thermal
   discomfort and water scarcity in urban areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {219},
Pages = {639-648},

Abstract = {This paper aims to evaluate the possibility of using the roofs of
   habitations in Caruaru city in the semiarid region of Pernambuco,
   Brazil, for two purposes: as green roofs to mitigate extreme
   temperatures inside the houses and for rainwater harvesting and storage
   for potable purposes. For this, a preliminary study was carried out with
   inside and outside temperature monitoring of rooms with a green roof and
   conventional roof to verify the thermal variation in a real situation.
   Furthermore, the potential of rainwater harvesting for Caruaru city was
   evaluated based on precipitation data provided by the Water National
   Agency and an estimation of the available roof area (buildings and
   houses). In this context, two scenarios were analysed: (scenario 1) the
   whole roof surface was used for rainwater harvesting and saving and
   (scenario 2) green roofs were implanted in part of the roofs.
   The results of this preliminary study indicated that the use of green
   roofs resulted in lower temperature variations throughout the day,
   decreased internal temperatures, and decreased thermal amplitude in
   relation to a conventional roof (with tiles). Regarding the reduction of
   the catchment area because of the recommended use of green roofs in a
   semiarid region, considering green roof application just over the
   bedrooms (which was considered to cover 16 m(2) in total), the water
   saving potential of the public supply system decreased, with a monthly
   average of 23.13\% versus 28.43\% (without green roofs). Implanting
   green roofs in part of the roofs of houses, although there is a
   reduction in the rainwater volume that can be harvested, can result in
   an increase in thermal comfort, whereas this is not feasible with the
   use of the entire roof area to harvest potable water. Thereby, the
   results indicate that the simultaneous use of the two kinds of roofs
   (conventional and green) is feasible even in a semiarid climate. (C)

Journal = {GEOSPATIAL HEALTH},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Trypanosoma cruzi requires a triatomine insect vector for its life
   cycle, which can be complex in different enzootic scenarios, one of
   which is the unique transmission network in the Atlantic Forest of
   south-eastern Brazil. In Espirito Santo (ES) State, highly infected
   Triatoma vitticeps are frequently reported invading domi-ciles. However,
   triatomines were not found colonizing residences and mammals in the
   surrounding areas did not present T. cruzi infection. To date, the
   biotic and abiotic variables that modulate T. vitticeps occurrence and
   T. cruzi infection in ES State are still unknown. The aim of this study
   was to identify the environmental variables that modulate their
   occurrence. Local thematic maps were generated for two response
   variables: T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi infection. The following
   explanatory variables were tested: climate (temperature, relative air
   humidity and rainfall), altitude elevation, mammalian species richness
   as well as soil and vegetation types. Spatiotemporal distribution
   patterns and correla-tion levels between response and explanatory
   variables were assessed through spatial statistics and map algebra
   modelling. The central and southern mesoregions presented higher T.
   vitticeps and T. cruzi distributions and can be considered transmission
   hotspots. The explanatory variables that can explain these phenomena
   were relative air humidity, average temperature, soil type, altitude
   ele-vation and mammalian species richness. Algebra map modelling
   demonstrated that central and southern mesoregions presented the
   environmental conditions needed for T. vitticeps occurrence and T. cruzi
   infection. The consideration of environmental variables is essential for
   understanding the T. cruzi transmission cycle. Cartographic and
   statistical methodologies used in parasitology have been demonstrated to
   be reliable and enlightening tools that should be incorporated routinely
   to expand the understanding of vector-borne parasite transmission.},

Title = {Photo-identification shows the spatio-temporal distribution of two sea
   turtle species in a Brazilian developmental foraging ground},
Journal = {MARINE BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {170},

Abstract = {Sea turtles spend most of their life cycle in foraging grounds. Research
   in developmental habitats is crucial to understanding individual
   dynamics and to support conservation strategies. One approach to gather
   information in foraging grounds is the use of cost-effective and
   non-invasive techniques that allow public participation. The present
   study aimed to use photographic-identification (photo-ID) to investigate
   the spatio-temporal distribution of Chelonia mydas and Eretmochelys
   imbricata. Furthermore, we describe fibropapillomatosis occurrence. This
   work was carried out at subtropical rocky reefs of the Brazilian coast
   in Arraial do Cabo (22 degrees 57MODIFIER LETTER PRIMES, 42 degrees
   01MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEW), within a sustainable conservation unit. A
   total of 641 images were obtained through social media screening (n =
   447), citizen science (n = 168), or intentional capture (n = 26) dated
   between 2006 and 2021. Additionally, 19 diving forms (between 2019 and
   2021) were received from citizen scientists. All diving forms presented
   at least one turtle. Photo-ID identified 174 individuals of C. mydas,
   with 45 being resighted, while E. imbricata had 32 individuals, with 7
   individuals resighted. The median interval between the first and last
   individual sighting was 1.7 years for C. mydas and 2.4 years for E.
   imbricata. Fibropapillomatosis was only observed in C. mydas, with a
   prevalence of 13.99\% (20 of 143 individuals) and regression in 2
   individuals (10.00\%). Our results indicated that Arraial do Cabo is an
   important development area with individuals residing for at least 6
   years. This study demonstrated that social media, along with photo-ID,
   can be useful to provide sea turtle estimates in a foraging ground using
   a non-invasive, low-cost method.},

Title = {Leave forever or return home? The case of the whitemouth croaker
   Micropogonias furnieri in coastal systems of southeastern Brazil
   indicated by otolith microchemistry},
Journal = {MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {144},
Pages = {28-35},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Movements of coastal fish species between estuarine systems (rearing
   grounds) and adjacent platforms (spawning grounds) are complex and can
   be influenced by multiple biotic and abiotic factors associated with the
   life cycle of each species. Understanding fish movement patterns between
   these habitats is crucial for sustainable management of these resources.
   We aimed to identify movement patterns of the whitemouth croaker
   Micropogonias furnieri, an important fishery resource along the
   southeastern Brazilian coast, through characterization of elemental
   concentration profiles in otoliths. Signal intensity ratios of
   Sr-86:Ca-43 and Ba-138:Ca-43, measured by a Laser ablation inductively
   coupled to a plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS), were analysed.
   Juveniles and adults fish from three semi-enclosed systems (two bays and
   one coastal lagoon) and adults from nine adjacent coastal areas were
   examined. Three main behavioural patterns were identified: 1) Marine
   Migrant, with a unique and definitive movement from the estuarine area
   towards the adjacent platform when adult; 2) Estuarine Visitor, with
   movements from the estuarine area towards the adjacent platform when
   adult but also performing excursions back to the estuarine areas and
   back again to the adjacent platform; and 3) Nearshore Resident, with
   occurrence in the adjacent coastal areas that are influenced by
   estuarine systems. Estuarine areas with large sea connections (e.g.,
   bays) favour more frequent fish entrances and exits compared with
   coastal lagoons that have a narrow sea connection. The high eurioic
   condition and capacity related to adapting to different environmental
   conditions were detected in this study for M. furnieri, a likely
   strategy to maintain variation in life histories and successfully adapt
   to coastal marine systems.},

Abstract = {Movement is a key factor that shapes the distribution and structure of
   fish populations and influences the extent of the benefits provided by
   conservation and management measures, such as the implementation of
   marine no-take zones (NTZs). We used visual surveys and acoustic
   telemetry to investigate density and movement of 2 Brazilian endemic and
   highly targeted reef fish species inside and outside a coral reef NTZ,
   and subsequently inferred the effectiveness of the NTZ for protecting
   these species. To do so, visual surveys were performed on protected and
   unprotected reefs between 2016 and 2017. Moreover, 20 gray parrotfish
   Sparisoma axillare and 9 Brazilian snapper Lutjanus alexandrei were
   tagged with acoustic transmitters and passively monitored from December
   2016 to October 2017. For both species, fish densities were
   significantly higher within the NTZ. Also, both species presented a high
   residence index over the short term, indicating they were full-time
   residents of the monitored area until detections were permanently lost.
   The absence of detections may indicate relocation to deeper reefs,
   predation, or fishing mortality when fish left the NTZ. Home ranges were
   small (0.10 to 0.45 km(2)), and both species presented spatially
   segregated subgroups within the populations. On average, the percentage
   of the home ranges within the NTZ was 88\% for S. axillare and 95\% for
   L. alexandrei. The results showed that small NTZs that are important to
   part of the life cycle of a target species are an effective measure to
   conserve reef fish populations, and also highlight the importance of
   fisheries management outside NTZs.},

Title = {Environmental and techno-economic considerations on biodiesel production
   from waste frying oil in Sao Paulo city},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {183},
Pages = {1034-1042},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Biodiesel is a renewable and biodegradable fuel that reduces the
   greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. However, the use of food
   oils in biodiesel production is severely criticised because its impacts
   on food prices, increase in crop area and deforestation. Thus, the
   production of biodiesel from non-food sources should be encouraged. This
   study was aimed at producing biodiesel from waste frying oil from
   residences and restaurants in an economically and environment-friendly
   manner. Therefore, a kinetic study of the transesterification reaction
   was carried out for each frying oil source. Energy and greenhouse gas
   emission efficiency values were measured in a diesel oil engine.
   Managers and residents answered some questions for evaluation of the
   environmental and economic sustainability of the city of Sao Paulo. The
   results of measurements showed that the biodiesel kinetics were zero
   order relative to frying oil concentration, leading to a 90.10\% yield,
   and biodiesel physicochemical properties were in compliance with the
   Brazilian standards. For blends up to 30\%, net power of each biodiesel
   was equal to that of diesel oil, but the reduction in greenhouse gas
   emissions were reduced by 33\% compared to diesel oil. The statistical
   survey revealed that the city of Sao Paulo has a production potential of
   more than 8800 m(3) per month, which can generate savings of US\$
   5,000,000 per month and an additional profit of US\$ 7,000,000 per month
   owing to the sale of excess biodiesel, glycerin, and carbon credits.
   Thus, this work shows how to make the city more sustainable and
   contributes to the improvement of its image. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Assessment of Potable Water Savings in Office Buildings Considering
   Embodied Energy},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {The objective of this article is to assess the potential for potable
   water savings in office buildings located in Florianpolis, southern
   Brazil. The embodied energy of four alternatives to reduce potable water
   demand, i.e., rainwater harvesting, greywater reuse, dual-flush toilets
   and water-saving taps, was also assessed. The analyses took into account
   the potable water end-uses for ten buildings. The potential for potable
   water savings by using rainwater, as well as, the rainwater tank sizing
   were estimated using computer simulation. As for greywater reuse, it was
   considered that greywater from lavatory taps could be treated and reused
   to flush toilets. The potential for potable water savings by using
   water-saving plumbing fixtures was estimated by considering the
   replacement of toilets and taps. In order to estimate the embodied
   energy in the main components, each system was dimensioned and embodied
   energy indices were applied. The main result is that the potential for
   potable water savings by using dual-flush toilets ranges from 21.6 \% to
   57.4 \%; by reusing greywater, it ranges from 6.8 \% to 38.4 \%; by
   using rainwater, it ranges from 6.1 \% to 21.2 \%; by using water-saving
   taps it ranges from 2.7 \% to 15.4 \%. However, by considering the
   embodied energy, the average for the ten buildings indicates that
   dual-flush toilets are the best choice as it is possible to obtain water
   savings of 5.50 m(3)/month per GJ of embodied energy, followed,
   respectively, by water-saving taps, greywater reuse and rainwater usage.
   The main conclusion is that the assessment of embodied energy should be
   considered when evaluating potable water savings in buildings as it
   helps to identify the best alternatives to save more water while causing
   less environmental impact.},

Abstract = {South American lithic cleavers are heavy curved artifacts distributed
   throughout the tropical Upper Parana ` Atlantic Forest in the
   southeastern lowlands of the subcontinent. The most reliable
   stratigraphic data and associated radiocarbon dates show that they were
   produced from the early-middle Holocene to the late-middle Holocene
   boundary. The cleavers were shaped by bifacial flaking and secondarily
   by pressure using pebbles, and to a lesser extent, thick flakes. The
   most used rock for its manufacture was silicified sandstone. The classic
   design of these tools features a thick, bi-concave neck with expanded
   shoulder, and a long, triangular and tapered blade with a rounded tip,
   which has undergone a rejuvenation process throughout its life cycle.
   Although they have some morphometric variations along their distribution
   range, they have the same bauplan. Indeed, the geometric morphometry
   analysis does not show significant differences between the designs of
   the cleavers from the Upper Paran ` a River in Argentina, and the Upper
   Uruguay in Brazil, reflecting the existence of a shared learning lineage
   in both valleys. Cleavers are recognized at sites that appear to have
   been residential camps, but quite often they are recovered isolated and
   distributed in the landscape, suggesting their use in obtaining
   resources. A fraction of them present a gloss on their tips visible to
   the naked eye. The microwear analysis of cleavers shows intense
   modifications in the first two to four cm from the tips of their blades,
   showing polished areas, and systematically orientated striations which
   are compatible with the processing of soft and semi-hard plant tissues,
   especially tubers. These results place these artifacts in the discussion
   about the systematic exploitation and even manip-ulation of plants in
   the Atlantic Forest during the early and middle Holocene.},

Title = {Reproductive aspects of the caridean shrimp Atya scabra (Leach,

Abstract = {The caridean freshwater shrimp Atya scabra is a common resident of
   stream systems of tropical rainforests in America, including Brazilian
   drainages. This shrimp has an amphidromous life cycle, which increases
   its vulnerability when facing habitat fragmentation. Since information
   on the reproduction of this species is still limited, we present here
   data on egg production, egg loss, and energy investment, to achieve a
   better understanding of reproductive features of A. scabra. Specimens
   were collected between 2006 and 2007 in Sao Sebastiao Island,
   southeastern Brazil, in 13 locations. The fecundity of 21 ovigerous
   females analyzed ranged between 414 and 19,250 eggs, which were higher
   than previously reported. However, the larger size of females analyzed
   may explain the observed intraspecific difference in egg production.
   During embryogenesis, egg volume and water content increased by 103 and
   22.6\%, respectively. The initial egg volume of A. scabra in the present
   study (0.027 mm(3)) was slightly lower, but comparable to the values
   reported previously from the same study area. During incubation, females
   of A. scabra lost 15\% of their initially produced eggs. The
   reproductive output (average RO of 3.6\%) is the first report for any
   atyid species. Its value is fairly low compared to other freshwater
   shrimps, and it is hypothesized that this might be related to a high
   energy investment in morphological adaptations, which allows the shrimp
   to cling on to the substrate in the fast flowing environment they
   inhabit. Additionally, the long life span, a well-known phenomenon in
   atyid shrimp, may allow the species to invest a relatively low amount of
   energy per brood in egg production, but over a longer time span.},

Abstract = {Leishmaniasis is an important metazoonosis caused by protozoa of the
   genus Leishmania and has a heteroxenic life cycle involving invertebrate
   and vertebrate hosts. Transmission occurs during the blood meal of
   infected phlebotomine sand flies in wild species, domestic animals, and
   humans. The dog is a reservoir for the parasite causing visceral
   leishmaniasis (VL), whereas in American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL),
   dogs are erratic hosts that are accidentally infected, as in humans.
   Dogs are considered an important indicator of the parasite and its
   vectors in the environment, thus highlighting the importance of
   diagnosis in these animals. This study aimed to assess the
   seroepidemiology of Leishmania spp. in dogs in the municipality of
   Telemaco Borba that were part of a castration campaign. Blood samples
   from 191 dogs were collected, and their owners were surveyed on various
   epidemiological variables. Serological analysis was performed using
   indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and rapid immunochromatography (DPP
   (R)). Screening by IIF identified 13 (6.81\%) positive animals, none of
   which were positive for the DPP (R) test, which is specific for VL.
   Statistical analysis of the questionnaire responses indicated a
   significant association between seropositivity and the presence of
   stacked or composting leaves in the backyard (p = 0.0498), forest areas
   (squares, woods, parks) near the residence (p = 0.0015), and poorly
   healing ulcerated or nodular epidermal lesions in the dog (p = 0.0138).
   This study revealed the presence of anti-Leishmania spp. IgG antibodies
   in dogs residing in Telemaco Borba, suggesting the presence of the
   parasite and vector in the environment. In addition, the existence of
   stacked or composting leaves in the backyard, forest areas near the
   residence, and epidermal lesions in dogs are factors associated with
   Leishmania spp. infection in pet dogs.},

Abstract = {Marked heterogeneity exists in the patterns of parasitic infection
   between individuals, households and communities. Analysis of parasite
   distributions within populations is complicated by the fact that
   parasite distributions are highly aggregated and few studies have
   explicitly incorporated this distribution when investigating small-scale
   spatial heterogeneities. This study aimed to quantify the small scale
   (within- and between-household) heterogeneity of helminth infection in
   an area of Minas Gerais State, Brazil, with rural and urban sectors.
   Parasitological data from a cross-sectional survey of 1,249 individuals
   aged 0-86 years from 242 households were analysed. Within-household
   clustering of infection was assessed using random effect logistic
   regression models and between-household spatial heterogeneity was
   assessed using a Bayesian negative binomial spatial model. The overall
   prevalence of hookworm (Necator americanus) was 66.9\%, the prevalence
   of Schistosoma mansoni was 44.9\% and the prevalence of Ascaris
   lumbricoides was 48.8\%. Statistical analysis indicated significant
   (within) household and (between household) spatial clustering of
   hookworm in both rural and urban areas and of S. mansoni in rural areas.
   There was no evidence of either household or spatial clustering of S.
   mansoni in urban areas. The spatial correlation of S. mansoni was
   estimated to reduce by half over a distance of 700 m in the rural area.
   Rural hookworm had a much smaller half-distance (28 m) and urban
   hookworm showed an even smaller half-distance (12 m). We suggest that
   such species-specific differences in patterns of infection by
   environment are primarily due to variation in exposure and parasite life
   cycle, although host genetic factors cannot be ruled out. (c) 2006

Abstract = {It is demonstrated that dispersed biomass residues (bagasse, sawdust)
   can be processed into hard carbonaceous blocks, panels or boards with
   good strength and thermodynamic properties. There are two possible
   approaches: to mould dispersed biomass charcoal with a
   phenol-formaldehyde binder or to produce this material by carbonising
   the biomass fiberboard prepared by making use of steam explosion
   autohydrolysis pulp or steam explosion lignin as a binder.
   In the first step, steam explosion lignin, as a modifier and a binder is
   introduced to the lignocellulosic biomass by impregnation or during the
   hot pressing process to form a hard fiberboard. By subsequent
   carbonisation of the fiberboard panels or blocks, carbonised panels or
   blocks with high bending and crushing strength and suitable
   thermodynamic properties are obtained due to the formation of an
   internal lignin reinforcement in cell lumina and impregnation of cell
   walls with lignin solution or molten lignin. The carbonised panels
   demonstrate a good dimensional stability after a standard treatment with
   water. The bending strength of the carbonised panels after 24 h soaking
   in water is 93\% of that in dry state. The thermodynamic properties and
   porosity of the carbonised panels demonstrate their suitability for use
   as a building material. Lignin, a natural binder of fiberboards, has
   proven to be suitable for preparation of cabonaceous panels and boards.
   In this respect new carbon building blocks and panels from moulded
   biomass and carbonised steam exploded biomass act as a concentrated form
   of long term carbon storage and will be a factor stabilizing the growing
   CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. {[}Proceedings of the First

Title = {Reverse logistics systems in Brazil: Comparative study and interest of
   multistakeholders},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {250},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Inadequate solid waste management leads to contamination of the soil and
   surface and underground water; the emergence of antibiotic-resistant
   superbacteria due to the inadequate disposal of medicines in toilets or
   in household rubbish; and the emission of persistent organic pollutants,
   such as flame retardants, present in some electrical/electronic
   equipment.
   In Brazil, the principles that underpin the National Solid Waste Policy
   (PNRS) are consistent with those used by developed countries, namely,
   the polluter-payer and protector-receiver; cooperation among the
   different spheres of government, the business sector, and other societal
   segments; and the shared product life-cycle responsibility (Brasil,
   2010a; Novi et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2019). In the latter, selective
   collection and reverse logistics systems are the primary instruments
   (Zhang et al., 2011).
   Thus, the general objective of this work is to compare the technical and
   economic feasibility of four different sectorial agreements for reverse
   logistics implemented in Brazil. The specific objective is to describe
   the possible conflicts of interest of the multistakeholders.
   The sources of evidence used in this multi-case study were interviews,
   observations, and documentary research in the period from 2016 to 2018.
   The first result demonstrated that the economic viability of reverse
   logistics systems are obtained when the wastes have a commercial value
   after consumption (packaging and consumer electronics) or when
   industries organize to charge a fee that covers the costs of recycling
   and transport (lamps and medicines). The second result shows that there
   are many stakeholders involved in this process: manufacturers and
   importers, consumers, private waste and recycling companies, and
   government represented by municipalities, the Ministry of the
   Environment (MMA), and state environmental agencies (OEMAs). Each one
   has different interests and responsibilities: government has to preserve
   the environment and comply with international agreements on climate
   change, thus creating laws that ultimately burden companies and cities;
   profit-maximizing companies evaluate these rules as additional costs in
   their operations, whereas cities, in which operations are conducted,
   have low financial and managerial capacity. The stakeholder map reveals
   that there are overlapping roles among agents, with some being the same
   for all chains, and the constructed power and level of interest matrix
   indicates the importance of the process to be conducted by the state to
   align economic and social-environmental interests.},

Abstract = {Brazil is one of the few countries where the water heating for bath is
   performed by using electric showerheads. The widespread use of these
   devices is the mainly responsible for the high peak on the electricity
   demand of the residential sector, observed between 18: 00 and 21: 00
   hours. As a consequence of that, costs and service quality are
   undermined, affecting consumers and the electricity sector in general.
   In attempt to deal with this issue, solar hot water systems have been
   proposed as an option to reduce the electricity consumption of the
   showerheads. However, despite of the high incidence of solar radiation
   on the Brazilian territory indicates a significant economy, currently
   there is no technical assessment quantifying the economic benefits on
   the region. The present study estimates the economic impacts resulting
   by the deployment of solar hot water systems in Brazilian households.
   Hence, the feasibility study allows assessing the potential of solar
   water heating as alternative to reduce the peak on the electricity
   demand in Brazil. In order to perform the proposed analysis, long-term
   performance simulations were performed on an hourly basis using the
   TRNSYS software as computational tool and typical meteorological year
   (TMY) files as input data. The TRNSYS component (Type 45) relating the
   solar water heating equipment had been experimentally validated, whereas
   the weather data was obtained from the SWERA database. Also, a time
   dependent profile of the heating demand is considered, according the
   measurements collected in previous studies. The thermal performance is
   evaluated in terms of solar fraction. On the other hand, the economic
   impacts are quantified in terms of three criteria for economic
   feasibility, such as payback period, internal rate of return and life
   cycle savings. In order to explore the benefits arising from different
   policies, four tariff scenarios are considered. The economic evaluation
   is positive over all scenarios analyzed, showing savings for both, the
   consumers and the electricity sector. The results of this analysis can
   be used as support tool for target setting the adoption or spread the
   use solar water heaters, or even to create policies for its diffusion.

Title = {Wood consumption and fixations of carbon dioxide and carbon from timber
   housing techniques: A Brazilian panorama},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {216},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {This paper evaluated lignocellulosic biomass volume, in net and gross
   forms, consumed by Brazilian wood-based housing producers by building
   technique, as well as net volumes of fixed carbon and carbon dioxide by
   built area. Net volumetric values of consumed wood per available
   technique were obtained for single-story house with 100 m(2) of built
   area, whose data collection was supported by face-to-face interviews
   with Brazilian producers. Gross volumes were obtained according to wood
   machining yield described in literature. Determinations of fixed carbon
   and carbon dioxide were verified by means of net volumes per built area,
   being calculated from data collected in the interviews. In wood
   consumption for this standard 100 m(2) house, most of construction
   techniques revealed average net volumes from 8 to 15 m(3) and gross
   volumes from 15 to 24 m(3) and from 13 to 21 m(3), respectively, for
   30\% and 55\% yields. In net volumes for 100 m(2) house, the lowest wood
   consumption was 2 m(3) (or 0.02 m(3) per m(2) of built area) obtained by
   two versions of nailed clapboard technique, while the highest amount of
   wood consumed was 34 m(3) (0.34 m(3)/m(2)) for modular technique in
   cross-laminated timber. As regards carbon fixation, contemporary
   techniques mostly based on eucalypt and pine species ranged from 30 to
   40 kg(C)/m(2), while this range was from 35 to 55 kg(C)/m(2) for
   traditional techniques largely made with natives. For native woods, the
   lowest carbon fixation was obtained by stick with masonry technique with
   parica(12 kg(C)/m(2)), and the highest value was observed in log-home
   technique using sapucaia (92 kg(C)/m(2)). In exotics, modular for
   construction site with loblolly pine presented the lowest fixation (19
   kg(C)/m(2)), and the possibility of modular technique in cross-laminated
   timber with blue spotted gum had the highest level (107 kg(C)/m(2)).
   High wood consumptions were influenced by obsolete production
   technologies and robust techniques, evincing expressive fixations. (C)

Abstract = {Accurate determination of infection with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
   herpesvirus (KSHV) has been hindered by the lack of a ``gold
   standard{''} for comparison of serological assays used to estimate KSRV
   prevalence in serosurveys conducted in different settings. We have
   evaluated the performance of five in-house (developed at University
   College London {[}UCL], United Kingdom, and at the virology laboratory
   of the Instituto de Medicine Tropical {[}IMT] in Sao Paulo, Brazil) and
   two commercial (ABI and DIAVIR) serological assays to detect antibodies
   to latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) and to lytic KSHV antigens.
   We used a variety of serum samples assembled to represent populations
   likely to be at high, intermediate, and low risk of KSHV infection in
   Brazil. Composite reference standard panels were prepared based on
   clinical and serological parameters, against which assay performances
   were assessed using conventional Bayesian statistics and latent class
   analysis (LCA). Against the clinical reference standard, in-house
   immunofluorescence assays to detect anti-LANA antibodies (IFA-LANA)
   produced at UCL and IMT had similar performances, with sensitivities of
   61\% (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 48\% to 74\%) and 72\% (95\% CI,
   58\% to 83\%) and specificities of 99\% (95\% CI, 94\% to 100\%) and
   100\% (95\% CI, 96\% to 100\%), respectively, and only the IMT IFA-LANA
   was included in LCA, together with the IMT IFA-lytic and four
   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). The LCA indicated that the
   IMT whole-virus ELISA performed best (sensitivity, 87\% {[}95\% CI, 81\%
   to 91\%]; and specificity, 100\% {[}95\% CI, 98\% to 100\%]), confirming
   the results obtained with the conventional statistical approach.
   Commercially available ELISA-based tests yielded the lowest
   specificities using a spectrum of serum samples. The evaluation of KSHV
   serological assays is warranted before planning serosurveys in various
   settings.},

Title = {Humans influence shark behavior: Evidence from the COVID-19 lockdown},
Journal = {OCEAN \& COASTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {248},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Achieving the UN SD Goals requires the conservation of keystone marine
   species. As top predators, many sharks play a crucial role in balancing
   marine ecosystems; yet, they have been experiencing severe population
   declines. Overfishing is indisputably the main threat to shark
   populations, but little is known about the impact of nonextractive human
   pressure. This study tests the effect of varied human presence on shark
   behavior at an insular marine reserve. In 2020, humans were virtually
   absent from Fernando de Noronha (FEN), Brazil, during a 211-days
   lockdown period prompted by the COVID-19 pandemics. A local shark
   tracking program rendered nearly 280000 acoustic detections in coastal
   waters from 2016 through 2021. Lemon sharks, Negaprion brevirostris,
   showed a 43\% increase in detection rate during the lockdown which was
   ascribed to the concomitant decrease in human presence. In contrast, the
   detection rate of tiger sharks, Galeocerdo cuvier, decreased by 67\%
   during the lockdown, but this trend was likely related to seasonality in
   tiger shark behavior. After the lockdown, both species' detection rates
   tended to return to previous levels. Further, lemon sharks increased
   diurnal coastal residency and made more use of areas less restrictive to
   human use during the lockdown, whilst tiger sharks increased nocturnal
   coastal residency during and after the lockdown period. Contrasting
   trends might relate with lemon sharks completing their life cycle in FEN
   and tiger sharks being migrants arriving to FEN at older ages and being
   less exposed to local anthropogenic stimuli across ontogeny. This study
   demonstrates that non-extractive human disturbance can induce
   significant changes in the way marine predators explore crucial habitats
   for accomplishing trophic, reproductive, and ontogenetic functions.
   Ascertaining the ecological impacts of marinebased human development
   should thus consider cryptic responses by keystone megafauna to the
   anthropogenic landscape produced by an ever-growing coastal population.
   The designation of human exclusion marine areas could emerge as the
   single solution to endow shark populations with suitable habitats for
   optimizing their resilience to human pressure.},

   new configurations of integrated waste-to-energy/gas turbine cycles, but
   a question still remains: ``Instead of building new natural gas power
   plants or installing conventional waste-to-energy facilities, should one
   be investing in flexible efficient hybrid plants?{''} This article aims
   at presenting a novel comprehensive approach to help answering this
   question. The strategy intends to demonstrate how to integrate four
   known key procedures (energy, exergy, economic and environmental
   analysis) in an original manner in order to evaluate the feasibility of
   such systems. The technique consists of a conventional Energy-Exergy
   analysis followed by a new Environmental-Economic approach. The
   novelties are in the economic and environmental parts, namely: (i) the
   use of multiple cost equations for estimating the plant's initial
   investment range and (ii) the indirect estimate of the pollution
   abatement system cost through an energy-ecological efficiency indicator.
   A case study configuration (similar to the existing plant of Bilbao) is
   used as exercise to demonstrate the method and its comparability
   potential, as well as to allow discussion using tangible results. The
   case-studied plant has a power output capacity of 107 MWe, thermal
   efficiency of 36\%, ecological efficiency of 89\%, thermal waste input
   capacity of 155 MWt and levelized cost of electricity production of US\$
   64-89 per MWh. It is compared to several existing single-fueled
   waste-to-energy facilities and other energy sources, including renewable
   and non-renewable. As unique findings of this research, it is shown that
   the proposed economic method allows to predict costs quite accurately
   and that the specific investment costs of such technology are very
   attractive compared to existing single-fueled waste-to-energy facilities
   in Europe and other electricity sources in the Brazilian context. The
   proposed method proved to be a comprehensive procedure to analytically
   evaluate the feasibility of hybrid waste-to-energy power plants, which
   present good potential in the Energy conversion field.},

Abstract = {This paper proposes to investigate the Brazilian building simulation
   market landscape and analyzes the possible adherence of the ASHRAE
   Standard 209 guidelines to the national context, especially for the
   compliance of ASHRAE's standard to the most used certification,
   labeling, and normative processes in Brazil.
   To accomplish these goals, two surveys were carried among building
   simulation practitioners, as well as among companies that request
   building simulation services in their projects. The purpose of such
   surveys was to evaluate how the simulation tools were applied in the
   Brazilian market, especially what kind of analysis was employed, to what
   end, and in what design phase according to the ASHRAE's 209 guidelines.
   Furthermore, an evaluation of the survey's results evaluation was
   carried out to serve as a roadmap to the draft of a national standard
   for building simulation applications like the ASHRAE 209.
   The results show that building simulation is mainly used for thermal and
   energy evaluation in the schematic design of construction documentation.
   It could be argued that certification, labeling, and normative processes
   have driven this trend, as they are indicated to be the company's main
   concern. Additionally, there are signs of implementation of building
   performance simulation in earlier phases, however, they seem to be more
   focused on the evaluation of active systems and envelope materials.
   These aspects highlight the importance of a common guideline to
   standardize the practice and foster best practices to all phases,
   earlier and after executive stages, in the same way as the ASHRAE 209.
   The dissemination of this analysis and the proposed standard may also
   contribute to making companies aware of the advantages of using computer
   simulation during the design process and throughout the building's life
   cycle. Furthermore, the emphasis on thermal and energy analysis draws
   attention to the need for a more comprehensive approach that can include
   other sorts of analysis, such as daylight, air quality, microclimate,
   acoustics, passive bioclimatic solutions, and others in the same
   framework and workflow.},

Title = {The influence of sugarcane pre-harvest fire on hantavirus prevalence in
   Neotropical small mammals},
Journal = {ECOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The use of pre-harvest fire in sugarcane fields surprisingly results in
   an increase in the abundance of Neotropical Sigmodontinae rodents, which
   might carry hantavirus. By contrast, fire suspension induces a decline
   in rodents in the first 5 years. The present study aimed to evaluate the
   effect of sugarcane harvest regimes on hantavirus prevalence in wild
   rodents. Field collections were carried out on a sugarcane production
   area in Northeast Sao Paulo, which is responsible for 30\% of the
   ethanol production in Brazil. A few years after pre-harvest fire
   suspension, a high prevalence of hantavirus was found in small rodents
   at lower population density, but apparently higher population growth
   rate. Differences in life cycle between the rodents and their predators
   may explain such density patterns, as small rodents can breed twice or
   even three times each year, whereas their predators usually breed only
   once a year. Similarly, the temporal dynamics of the predator-prey
   relationship suggests that hantavirus prevalence is related to small
   rodent's population growth and not density. Only Akodon montensis,
   Calomys tener, and Necromys lasiurus contained immunoglobulin G
   antibodies against the recombinant nucleoprotein of Araraquara
   orthohantavirus, a genotype of Andes orthohantavirus, with no
   interspecific variation in seroprevalence among these species. However,
   males presented higher prevalence rate than females, possibly due to a
   male-biased dispersal pattern and a higher frequency of antagonistic
   interactions. Governance measures to mitigate the role of small wild
   rodents on the emergence of hantavirus in agricultural landscapes
   dominated by sugarcane plantations should include the use of
   wildlife-friendly management techniques (e.g., to mitigate the mortality
   of the predators of small rodents), human capacity building concerning
   wildlife-related conflicts, and multifunctionality of agricultural
   landscapes. Future studies should prioritize the possible relationship
   between microhabitat structure and hantavirus prevalence in small
   rodents in agricultural landscapes dominated by sugarcane fields.},

Title = {Coral line algae enhance the settlement of the vermetid gastropod
   Dendropoma irregulare (d'Orbigny, 1842) in the southwestern
   Atlantic},

Abstract = {The Abrolhos reefs are the largest and the richest coral reefs of
   Brazil, where corals, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and vermetids are
   the main reef-building organisms. In the Abrolhos Archipelago, the
   vermetid Dendropoma irregulare (d'Orbigny, 1842) associated with the CCA
   Porolithon pachydermum (Foslie) Foslie, represents a significant portion
   of the reef edges. This study aimed to analyze the seasonal influence of
   the substrate and hydrodynamic exposure to vermetid D. irregulare
   settlement, and to verify if the biological cues might be acting in the
   vermetid settlement. Seasonal in situ settlement experiments were
   performed, testing different substrata (live coralline algae, dead
   coralline algae, and artificial substrate) in three study sites (Mato
   Verde, Caldeiros, and Siriba) and a seasonal exposure index was
   calculated. We found that P. pachydermum enhance settlement of D.
   irregulare in the Abrolhos reefs. The vermetid settlements were
   significantly higher on (1) substrates with live CCA, and (2) in the
   presence of substrates with live CCA cues. The highest vermetid
   settlements, which best reveal the positive effect of substrate cues
   (live coralline algae), were observed at Siriba during summer and
   autumn-winter, being more than twice that recorded in Mato Verde. It is
   suggested that features associated with live coralline surfaces may
   attract the settlement of the juvenile vermetid. This study revealed a
   significant positive correlation between settlements of the vermetid on
   live CCA and the degree of exposure to hydrodynamics, where the highest
   densities were observed in a moderate condition of exposure. Responses
   to the preferential settlement on live coralline algae surfaces in the
   present study are probably due to a complex of cues acting
   simultaneously, which includes the physical (hydrodynamics) and
   biological cues (biofilms). This study provides the first attempt to
   examination of the settlement factors of the vermetids, contributing to
   the role that live coralline may play as ``nursery habitats{''} in the
   Abrolhos Archipelago. Because of its ability to induce settlement of the
   crawling juvenile vermetid, CCA play a fundamental role in the life
   cycle of many marine invertebrates, including D. irregulare. (C) 2015

Title = {Environmental and financial multi-objective optimization: Hybrid
   wind-photovoltaic generation with battery energy storage systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {The present study proposes a multi-objective optimization method for
   wind and photovoltaic (PV) hybrid gen-eration with battery energy
   storage, considering a tariff policy issue for the grid-connected
   residential scenario. The proposed method used the Response Surface
   Methodology (RSM) to model two objective functions, one environmental
   (Carbon footprint) and the other financial (Net Present Value -NPV) in
   relation to four controllable variables. To perform the multi-objective
   optimization, the Normal-Boundary Intersection (NBI) was used to
   construct the Pareto frontier. Finally, the Levelized Cost of Energy
   (LCOE) criterion was used to select the best Pareto optimal point. The
   proposed model was applied in Brazilian cities from different geographic
   regions. The main results of the study indicated that only regions with
   favorable environmental conditions and higher energy tariffs became
   financially viable for the proposed model, with NPV values ranging from
   R\$-76,080.94 to R\$ 69,675.23. As for the Carbon footprint (emission of
   CO2eq), the values ranged from 8951.47 to 27,939.78 kgCO2/kWh, being
   strongly influenced by the adopted power generation technology. The use
   of LCOE to select the best solution provided a metric for the cost of
   implementing a technology, whose values ranged from 1.093 to 1.981
   R\$/kWh. It is still not advantageous to opt for the use of batteries
   for later use at peak hours, even when the tariff modality selected was
   the white tariff; and energy storage systems that could enable the
   imple-mentation of this policy proved to be economically unfeasible. In
   the current Brazilian legislation, the services and benefits generated
   by energy storage are not remunerated, which penalizes the investment in
   this type of technology. As proved, solar PV technology, despite being
   cheaper, was penalized by a greater need for storage capacity, which led
   to optimal configurations with greater participation of wind generation.
   This indicates the need for incentives mainly related to wind energy and
   batteries, which are still expensive elements in the na-tional scenario
   for a residential generation, reducing the probability of achieving
   economic viability.},

   frontier stages in the amazon},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {We investigate how Amazonian smallholders? land use systems coevolve
   with household-level demographic factors associated with changing
   livelihood strategies over the different stages of frontier development.
   Few micro-level studies have investigated this association, particularly
   due to the paucity of longitudinal data on cohorts of farm colonist
   households and plots. Cohort analysis is the only way to depict how the
   structural conditions affecting individual and household livelihood
   decisions differ from earlier to later stages of frontier development.
   Our methodological approach involves a unique dataset, based on a
   micro-level panel of farm households depicting 25 years of settlement in
   the municipality of Machadinho, in the Brazilian Amazon. We use
   descriptive statistics with paired t-tests, land use classification
   analysis, latent transition analysis, and longitudinal multinomial
   regressions to understand which cohorts of households thrived or failed
   and, most importantly, why and when. Splitting the data into panels of
   settlement cohorts helped us understand the effect of demographic life
   cycle markers on land use choices over the different stages of frontier
   development and the ability of farm households to adapt their
   livelihoods at the frontier over time. We found that, as the
   colonization frontier integrated into markets, the most successful
   original settlers were those who diversified their portfolio of capitals
   and livelihood strategies as a response to new local and regional market
   conditions. We also found a progressive change from land use systems
   based on subsistence agriculture to diversified land use systems that
   combine on-and off-farm activities. Livelihood diversification is key to
   preventing households from becoming trapped in a long-term deprivation
   trajectory, particularly when the frontier becomes more urban and
   market-oriented. This explains why land use has become progressively
   independent of household demographic dynamics in advanced stages. We
   contend that, as frontiers integrate into markets, diversification
   should not only be incentivized, but should also be used as a technical
   strategy to enhance access to subsidized rural credit, as it seems to
   increase farmers? likelihood to thrive and improve their resilience
   against shocks.},

Title = {Multiple behavioral risk factors for non-communicable diseases among the
   adolescent population in Brazil: the analysis derived from the Brazilian
   national survey of school health 2019},
Journal = {BMC PEDIATRICS},

Abstract = {BackgroundHealth risk behaviors often emerge or intensify during
   adolescence and tend to co-occur, exposing individuals to an even
   greater risk for the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
   The likelihood of exhibiting multiple health risk factors also increases
   throughout life and is associated with sociodemographic characteristics
   contributing to their escalation and severity. In this context, the
   objective of this study was to analyze the association between
   sociodemographic characteristics and multiple behavioral risk factors
   for non-communicable diseases among the adolescent population in
   Brazil.MethodsThis cross-sectional study utilized data from the
   Brazilian National Survey of School Health 2019. The sample comprised
   121,580 adolescents aged 13 to 17. The analyzed variables included
   irregular intake of fruits and vegetables, regular consumption of soft
   drinks and treats, insufficient physical activity, sedentary lifestyle,
   cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption. To analyze MBRFs, a
   classification ranging from zero to five was created, and associations
   were estimated using Odds Ratio (OR) with the respective 95\% confidence
   interval (CI). The Backward method was employed for the multivariate
   regression model, utilizing ordinal logistic
   regression.ResultsAdolescents without behavioral risk factors for NCDs
   constituted only 3.9\% (95\% CI 3.7-4.1). The most prevalent categories
   were two and three MBRFs, accounting for 28.3\% (95\% CI: 27.7-28.8) and
   27.0\% (95\% CI: 26.5-27.5), respectively. Adolescents aged 16 and 17
   (ORadj: 1.39; 95\% CI: 1.32-1.48), residing in the Brazilian Southeast
   (ORadj: 1.66; 95\% CI: 1.52-1.81), and those reporting poor or very poor
   self-rated health (ORadj: 2.05; 95\% CI: 1.87-2.25) were more likely to
   exhibit multiple behavioral risk factors. Conversely, male adolescents
   (adjusted OR: 0.65; 95\% CI: 0.62-0.69), those of mixed race (adjusted
   OR: 0.92; 95\% CI: 0.87-0.97), and residents of rural areas (adjusted
   OR: 0.76; 95\% CI: 0.70-0.84) were less likely to manifest MBRFs for
   NCDs.ConclusionThe majority of adolescents displayed MBRFs for NCDs,
   positively associated with age, region, and perceived health status.
   This underscores the necessity for healthcare promotional interventions
   throughout the life cycle, as these behaviors may persist into
   adulthood.},

Title = {Spatial and simultaneous representative seroprevalence of
   anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in owners and their domiciled
   dogs in a major city of southern Brazil},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, has traditionally been
   considered an important water and foodborne protozoonosis with important
   public health considerations. Although felids play a well-established
   role as definitive hosts, canine epidemiological involvement in the
   parasite's life cycle remains questionable and controversial. The
   increasing closeness of the human-dog bond, particularly seen in urban
   settings, has been recognized as a historically unprecedented worldwide
   movement. Sharing daily lives in the same households, dogs may be
   exposed to similar associated risks of T. gondii infection as their
   owners. Thus, epidemiological assessment of the intra-domiciled
   environment, especially among socio-economically different human
   populations, may provide novel information regarding the actual role of
   dogs in animal and human toxoplasmosis. Despite spatial approaches being
   recently used for other water and foodborne diseases, no study has been
   conducted on the simultaneous spatial seroprevalence of both human and
   animal IgG antiT. gondii antibodies in urban areas of major cities.
   Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to assess the
   seroprevalence and associated variables of Toxoplasma infection in
   owners and their domiciled dogs in Londrina, southern Brazil. Human and
   canine seroprevalence rates and variables associated with seroprevalence
   were investigated through representative random sampling among 564
   households, which included 597 owners and 729 dogs. Overall,
   statistically significant differences between the seroprevalence of
   human and dog anti-T. gondii antibodies were found by Immunofluorescence
   Antibody Testing in 248/597 (41.54\%) owners and 119/729 (16.32\%) dogs.
   Through multiple analysis, significant concomitant variables for
   seropositivity of household individuals (people and dogs) were
   determined, including public sewer service, yard cleaning frequency, and
   having a dirty yard. Although no statistically significant multiple
   logistic model was observed among owners, univariate analysis detected
   associations with monthly income, soil contact, and occupation. Among
   dogs, the absence of other dogs and the absence of a dirty yard were
   concomitant significantly protective associated factors. Age differences
   between seropositive and seronegative individuals was significant only
   for human beings, with the median age of negative individuals
   significantly higher than positive individuals. Although no spatial
   clusters were identified for humans or residences, a significant cluster
   was identified for dogs. In conclusion, characteristics of urban
   toxoplasmosis may include significantly higher owner seroprevalence than
   their owned dogs, with canine seroprevalence directly associated with
   having more dogs and a dirty backyard, and spatial differences in both
   human and dog exposures. Although not a good indicator for human
   foodborne diseases, dogs may be a reliable sentinel for environmental
   infection. Moreover, such a holistic approach may provide crucial
   information for more focused prevention and monitoring programs,
   particularly in households with multiple pets and trash-filled
   backyards.},

Abstract = {The lack of mass testing for COVID-19 diagnosis creates the need to
   determine the magnitude of the disease based on its clinical symptoms.
   The study aimed to analyze the profile of COVID-19 symptoms and related
   aspects in Brazil. The author analyzed the sample of participants from
   the Brazilian National Household Sample Survey (PNAD-COVID 19) conducted
   in May 2020. Latent class analysis (LCA) was performed with
   sociodemographic covariables and 11 symptoms reported by 346,181
   individuals. Rao-Scott test and standardized residual analysis were used
   to measure the association with the pattern of health services use.
   Spatial scan analysis was performed to identify areas at risk of
   COVID-19 cases. LCA showed six classes of symptoms based on the pattern
   of answers by participants: (1) all the symptoms; (2) high prevalence of
   symptoms; (3) predominance of fever; (4) predominance of cough/sore
   throat; (5) mild symptoms with predominance of headache; and (6) absence
   of symptoms. Female sex, brown skin color, the North and Northeast
   regions of Brazil, and all three older age brackets showed stronger
   association with the class with all the symptoms (class 1). Most use of
   health services was also by this group of individuals, but with
   different profiles of use. Spatial analysis showed juxtaposition of this
   class with areas at greater risk of COVID-19. These finding underline
   the importance of investigating symptoms for the epidemiological
   identification of possible cases in a scenario with low population
   testing rates.},

Abstract = {PurposeLaundry is a frequent household activity, performed either
   manually or by washing machine. This process consumes chemical products
   (such as laundry detergent and fabric softener), electricity, and water.
   It is therefore important to understand the environmental impacts and
   costs associated with laundry. The goal of this paper was to assess its
   eco-efficiency based on the NBR ISO 14045:2014 standard.MethodsPrimary
   data were collected from laundry detergent and fabric softener producers
   in Teresina, Piau \& iacute;, Brazil. Secondary data were collected from
   patents, a chemical industry association, the government labeling
   program, and municipal water and electricity suppliers. The product
   system boundaries were cradle-to-consumer, and the impact categories
   were global warming, freshwater eutrophication, and land use. The
   product system value indicator was the washing costs from the consumer's
   perspective. The environmental and product system value indicators were
   related using the eco-efficiency formula which resulted in the process
   eco-efficiency profile. An uncertainty analysis was carried out to
   measure errors intrinsic to the data and the methods. A sensitivity
   analysis was carried out to identify the influence of choices made
   during the study and to propose viable technical improvements.ResultsThe
   results showed that the most impactful processes in the three categories
   were electricity, wastewater treatment, and the chemical products
   (laundry detergent and fabric softener). In terms of product system
   value, the costs of water and sewage treatment had the highest
   contribution to the overall costs. It was not possible to identify the
   laundry eco-efficiency profile degree and to calculate the X factor, due
   to the lack of studies in this area. Greater uncertainties were found in
   the global warming category, due to its global scope, while freshwater
   eutrophication category has country-specific characterization factors. A
   new scenario was proposed to identify possible economically and
   environmentally feasible changes. However, it did not generate
   significant changes that would improve the eco-efficiency profile of the
   evaluated process.ConclusionsThis work highlights the eco-efficiency
   importance as an environmental management tool to support business
   decision-making and to identify the environmental impacts of domestic
   activities. By the results, washers and laundry products manufacturers
   know which areas they should invest in research and development to
   reduce their products' impacts. For future studies, it is recommended to
   evaluate the use of a detergent that does not require fabric softener,
   such as those sold by the brands Biozgreen, TerpenOil, and Yvy in the
   Brazilian market, and a high-efficiency washer.},

Title = {Assessment of the accuracy of 11 different diagnostic tests for the
   detection of Schistosomiasis mansoni in individuals from a
   Brazilian area of low endemicity using latent class analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Background: Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease associated with
   poverty. It is estimated that 7.1 million people are infected with
   Schistosoma mansoni in Latin America, with 95\% of them living in
   Brazil. Accurate diagnosis and timely treatment are important measures
   to control and eliminate schistosomiasis, but diagnostic improvements
   are needed to detect infections, especially in areas of low endemicity.
   Methodology: This research aimed to evaluate the performance of 11
   diagnostic tests using latent class analysis (LCA). A cross-sectional
   survey was undertaken in a low endemicity area of the municipality of
   Malacacheta, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Feces, urine, and blood samples were
   collected from 400 residents older than 6 years of age, who had not been
   treated with praziquantel in the 12 months previous to the collection of
   their samples. The collected samples were examined using parasitological
   (Helm Test((R)) kit Kato-Katz), nucleic acid amplification tests -NAATs
   (PCR, qPCR and LAMP on urine; PCR-ELISA, qPCR and LAMP on stool), and
   immunological (POC-CCA, the commercial anti-Schistosoma mansoni IgG
   ELISA kit from Euroimmun, and two in-house ELISA assays using either the
   recombinant antigen PPE or the synthetic peptide Smp150390.1) tests.
   Results: The positivity rate of the 11 tests evaluated ranged from 5\%
   (qPCR on urine) to 40.8\% (commercial ELISA kit). The estimated
   prevalence of schistosomiasis was 12\% (95\% CI: 9-15\%) according to
   the LCA. Among all tests assessed, the commercial ELISA kit had the
   highest estimated sensitivity (100\%), while the Kato-Katz had the
   highest estimated specificity (99\%). Based on the accuracy measures
   observed, we proposed three 2-step diagnostic approaches for the active
   search of infected people in endemic settings. The approaches proposed
   consist of combinations of commercial ELISA kit and NAATs tests
   performed on stool. All the approaches had higher sensitivity and
   specificity than the mean values observed for the 11 tests (70.4 and
   89.5\%, respectively).
   Conclusion: We showed that it is possible to achieve high specificity
   and sensitivity rates with lower costs by combining serological and
   NAATs tests, which would assist in the decision-making process for
   appropriate allocation of public funding aiming to achieve the WHO
   target of eliminating schistosomiasis as a public health problem by
   2030.},

Title = {Material eco-efficiency indicators for Brazilian buildings},
Journal = {SMART AND SUSTAINABLE BUILT ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {3},
Number = {1},
Pages = {54-71},
Abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a set of
   lifecycle-based indicators to describe material eco-efficiency of
   buildings normalized per unit of gross floor area (GFA), and at
   verifying feasibility of their calculation for building materials and
   components, based upon four case studies. The paper also examines the
   effects that discrepancies between two carbon footprint accounting
   methods (embodied CO2 (ECO2) vs embodied CO2e) have on communication of
   environmental performance of selected materials.
   Design/methodology/approach - The lifecycle assessments (LCAs) were
   performed through LCA support platform SimaPro 7.3. Data for
   materials/components production cycle modeling were collected from
   primary and secondary data from national literature or adapted from
   Ecoinvent database. Embodied energy, ECO2, blue water footprint (bWF),
   non-renewable content and volatile organic compound emissions (VOCe)
   indicators were calculated from lifecycle inventory (LCI) outputs, while
   embodied CO2e was calculated using CML 2001 v.2.01 impact assessment
   method.
   Findings - Obtained results suggest that a core database comprised of 12
   materials and components - cement, ceramic blocks, steel rebar, sawn
   timber planks, PVC tubes, plywood, PVC conduits, roof steel structure,
   roundwood, ceramic tiles, hydrated lime and adhesive mortar - provides a
   very reasonable description of a building's embodied energy (99.63
   percent), embodied CO2e (97.50 percent), bWF (96.26 percent),
   non-renewable content (97.53 percent) and VOCe (95.38 percent) profiles.
   Except for bWF of cement and concrete, substantial reductions in the
   metrics' values captured environmental advantages of partially
   substituting ground granulated blast furnace slag (ggbs) for clinker
   Portland.
   Originality/value - The disclosure of embodied energy and carbon, as
   well as of other environmental performance data at whole-building level
   (per unit of GFA) pointed out in this paper, allows comparability and
   helps to establish performance goals and benchmarks and to guide policy
   decisions. Following a coordinated methodological outline, future works
   are expected to evolve to gradually constitute a LCI database that
   enables the use of the proposed metrics and of LCA as decision-making
   tools in the building sector.},

Abstract = {This work aims to investigate the effect of process temperature and
   catalyst content by pyrolysis and thermal catalytic cracking of (organic
   matter + paper) fraction from municipal household solid waste (MHSW) on
   the yields of reaction products (bio-oil, bio-char, H2O, and gas), acid
   value, chemical composition of bio-oils, and characterization of
   bio-chars in laboratory scale. The collecting sectors of MHSW in the
   municipality of Belem-Para-Brazil were chosen based on geographic and
   socio-economic database. The MHSW collected and transported to the
   segregation area. The gravimetric analysis of MHSW was carried out and
   the fractions (Paper, Cardboard, Tetra Pack, Hard Plastic, Soft Plastic,
   Metal, Glass, Organic Matter, and Inert) were separated. The selected
   organic matter and paper were submitted to pre-treatment of crushing,
   drying, and sieving. The experiments carried out at 400, 450, and 475
   degrees C and 1.0 atmosphere, and at 475 degrees C and 1.0 atmosphere,
   using 5.0, 10.0, and 15.0\% (wt.) Ca(OH)(2), in batch mode. The bio-oil
   was characterized for acid value. The chemical functions present in
   bio-oil were identified by FT-IR and the composition was identified by
   GC-MS. The bio-char was characterized by SEM, FT-IR, and XRD. The
   variance in mass (wt.\%) for organic fractions of municipal household
   solid waste (OFMHSW), between 56.21 and 67.45\% (wt.), lies with the
   interval of 56\% (wt.) and 64\% (wt.) of OFMHSW for middle- and
   low-income countries. The pyrolysis of MHSW fraction (organic matter +
   paper) shows bio-oil yields between 2.63 and 9.41\% (wt.), aqueous phase
   yields between 28.58 and 35.08\% (wt.), solid phase yields between 35.29
   and 45.75\% (wt.), and gas yields between 16.54 and 26.72\% (wt.). The
   bio-oil yield increases with pyrolysis temperature. For the catalytic
   cracking, the bio-oil and gas yields increase slightly with CaO content,
   while that of bio-char decreases, and the H2O phase remains constant.
   The GC-MS of liquid reaction products identified the presence of
   hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, cycloalkanes, and aromatics)
   and oxygenates (carboxylic acids, ketones, esters, alcohols, phenols,
   and aldehydes), as well as compounds containing nitrogen, including
   amides and amines. The acidity of bio-oil decreases with increasing
   process temperature and with aid Ca(OH)(2) as a catalyst. The
   concentration of hydrocarbons in bio-oil increases with increasing
   Ca(OH)(2)-to-OFMHSW fraction ratio due to the catalytic deoxygenation of
   fatty acid molecules, by means of decarboxylation/decarbonylation,
   producing aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.},

Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Background: Neighborhood environment studies of physical activity (PA)
   have been mainly single-country focused. The International Prevalence
   Study (IPS) presented a rare opportunity to examine neighborhood
   features across countries. The purpose of this analysis was to: 1)
   detect international neighborhood typologies based on participants'
   response patterns to an environment survey and 2) to estimate
   associations between neighborhood environment patterns and PA.
   Methods: A Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was conducted on pooled IPS
   adults (N=11,541) aged 18 to 64 years old (mean=37.5 +/- 12.8 yrs;
   55.6\% women) from 11 countries including Belgium, Brazil, Canada,
   Colombia, Hong Kong, Japan, Lithuania, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and
   the U. S. This subset used the Physical Activity Neighborhood
   Environment Survey (PANES) that briefly assessed 7 attributes within
   10-15 minutes walk of participants' residences, including residential
   density, access to shops/services, recreational facilities, public
   transit facilities, presence of sidewalks and bike paths, and personal
   safety. LCA derived meaningful subgroups from participants' response
   patterns to PANES items, and participants were assigned to neighborhood
   types. The validated short-form International Physical Activity
   Questionnaire (IPAQ) measured likelihood of meeting the 150 minutes/week
   PA guideline. To validate derived classes, meeting the guideline either
   by walking or total PA was regressed on neighborhood types using a
   weighted generalized linear regression model, adjusting for gender, age
   and country.
   Results: A 5-subgroup solution fitted the dataset and was interpretable.
   Neighborhood types were labeled, ``Overall Activity Supportive (52\% of
   sample){''}, ``High Walkable and Unsafe with Few Recreation Facilities
   (16\%){''}, ``Safe with Active Transport Facilities (12\%){''},
   ``Transit and Shops Dense with Few Amenities (15\%){''}, and ``Safe but
   Activity Unsupportive (5\%){''}. Country representation differed by type
   (e. g., U. S. disproportionally represented ``Safe but Activity
   Unsupportive{''}). Compared to the Safe but Activity Unsupportive, two
   types showed greater odds of meeting PA guideline for walking outcome
   (High Walkable and Unsafe with Few Recreation Facilities, OR=2.26 (95\%
   CI 1.18-4.31); Overall Activity Supportive, OR=1.90 (95\% CI 1.13-3.21).
   Significant but smaller odds ratios were also found for total PA.
   Conclusions: Meaningful neighborhood patterns generalized across
   countries and explained practical differences in PA. These observational
   results support WHO/UN recommendations for programs and policies
   targeted to improve features of the neighborhood environment for PA.},

Abstract = {The effective implantation of the circular economy (CE) presents a great
   challenge to the industrial sectors, mostly in those of greater
   environmental impact, such as construction industry. In Brazil, this
   industry has been growing over the last 20 years; however, such growth
   was based on an extractivist economy without any consideration to the
   end of its products lifespan. Only in 2017, 45 million tonnes of
   construction and demolition waste were generated in the country. This
   paper presents the current context of public policies in the Brazilian
   construction industry and proposes initiatives to introduce principles
   of CE. An exploratory study was developed, and all the 45 references
   presented in Appendix A of the review paper of Benachio et al. were
   considered to draw new ideas. These ideas are related and compared to
   key points in Brazilian regulations. Twelve opportunities for the
   improvement are listed and organized by construction stages (planning
   and design, materials manufacturing, construction processes, use and
   demolition). The ones related to design and planning using Green
   building information modelling, and materials manufacturing with
   recycled waste are highlighted due to the existing actions, standards,
   and Federal legislation. It was found that some sectors and the
   government already have actions related to CE (based on the 3R
   principle), but still there are several initiatives needed for its
   effective implementation in the Brazilian construction industry.},

Title = {LEED certification as booster for sustainable buildings: Insights for a
   Brazilian context},
Journal = {RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {145},
Pages = {170-178},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Green labels have strong potential in identifying buildings with lower
   load on the natural environment, among which the leadership in energy
   and environmental design (LEED) is the most used certification
   worldwide. LEED's potential in truly reflecting a building's
   sustainability degree has been receiving criticisms in the scientific
   literature. The more recent LEED versions represent, in theory,
   improvements over the previous ones in an attempt to overcome such
   criticism. This work assesses the way in which LEED certification is
   pushing buildings towards higher sustainability degrees. Primary data
   are based on the Brazilian certified buildings up to 2016, totalizing
   276 projects evaluated under statistical approaches, including the
   Kruskall Wallis analysis, credit achievement degree, and skewness
   indices. Results show that energy \& atmosphere and material \& resource
   categories received lower scores among all other categories for the 2009
   LEED version than for the 2.0/2.2 version. The 2009 LEED framework
   allowed the certified Brazilian buildings to pursue those
   easier-to-obtain scores, which raises doubts about whether the LEED
   label push to strong sustainability since its core concept is based on
   energy and material consumption. Notwithstanding, the evaluated projects
   in Brazil pursue lower degrees of sustainability because they apply
   efforts in obtaining the minimum scores required by a specific label.
   Although demanding improvements, LEED certification should be promoted
   as an important tool towards sustainable development due to its
   innumerous advantages.},

Journal = {ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {269},

Abstract = {This work focuses on the numerical simulation of an on-grid hybrid
   combined heat and power (CHP) system to meet small residential demands,
   using natural gas and solar energy. The system includes a natural gas
   reformer, a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (FC), photovoltaic panels
   (PV) and batteries connected to the grid by a bidirectional inverter.
   The impact of four parameters in the economic viability are
   investigated: number of consumers, electric and natural gas tariffs
   evolution, reverse metering factor and configuration of the system
   (energy sources, with or without storage). The results showed that the
   system can feed up to 4 consumers without significantly purchasing
   energy from the grid. Also, the electric tariffs exert more influence
   than natural gas tariffs over the performance of the system in terms of
   net present value. Dealing with configuration aspect, the FC + PV
   configuration provided earlier payback predictions, since fewer
   equipment substitutions were required. Reverse metering factor impact on
   system's final profit and payback estimation was verified just slight.
   As results of environmental analysis conducted for the operation of the
   system, it was shown that emissions as low as 276.5 gCO(2)eq/kWh are
   achievable for the FC + PV configuration with cogeneration, meaning a
   61.5\% reduction in comparison with gas microturbines technology.},

Abstract = {Chagas disease (CD), caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is a
   neglected tropical disease with life-threatening implications. In this
   study, we conducted a seroepidemiological survey to determine the
   prevalence and clinical profiles of CD in 217 individuals from an
   impoverished rural community in Southern Bahia, Brazil. The overall
   prevalence of CD in the studied community was 0.92\%, detected through
   latent class analysis (LCA). Two individuals tested positive for anti-T.
   cruzi IgG, both being male farmers. One case was a 22-year-old man born
   in Camamu, with no evidence of congenital transmission, suggesting other
   routes of transmission such as vector-borne transmission due to
   migratory activities. The other case was a 69-year-old man born in Sao
   Felipe, who had lived in an adobe/brick house and had a pacemaker due to
   cardiac involvement caused by CD. The prevalence in this community was
   lower than expected, given the socioeconomic conditions and
   environmental factors that contribute to T. cruzi transmission. This
   could be attributed to the implementation of preventive measures and
   vector control programs by the Brazilian Government. However, continuous
   monitoring and surveillance are essential to sustain control efforts and
   detect any potential re-emergence of the disease. While the overall
   prevalence was low, the detection of positive cases underscores the need
   for continued surveillance and control measures in vulnerable
   populations, such as rural communities. Active surveillance, early
   diagnosis, and timely treatment are crucial in preventing disease
   progression and complications, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of
   screening and treatment programs.},

Abstract = {The increasing demand of housing in the Global South requires effective
   solutions to cover the corresponding deficit in the next decades. In
   Latin America, Brazil is the most populated Nation, which accounts for
   one-third of the total population and is the main contributor to carbon
   emissions. This study estimates how bio-based construction solutions,
   implemented in the Brazilian housing stock as alternative to
   conventional systems, can contribute to limiting the carbon emissions.
   Five different construction archetypes were considered, and a Material
   Flow Analysis model developed to estimate the demand of construction
   materials by 2050 under multiple scenarios. A carbon footprint
   assessment, which considers the dynamic effect of biogenic carbon
   sequestration and uptake, was finally performed to estimate the net
   Global Warming Potential. The results indicate that, if fast
   implemented, bio-concrete solutions with short-rotation vegetal species
   as bamboo, coupled with the lowest material intensity scenario, can
   reduce the cumulative carbon emissions by 65\%, equal to 118 Mt of
   cumulative CO2-eq savings. Considering bamboo's widespread availability
   in Brazil's different climate zones, and in the Global South in general,
   such material presents a significant impact to mitigate the climate
   impact of social housing. However, the carbon saving intensity is
   largely affected by uncertainties on population growth and the type of
   biomass used in the concrete mixture. Therefore, further development of
   standards for the safe use of bio -concrete in construction is urgently
   needed, as well as the implementation of environmental policies to
   facilitate the market penetration of bio-based solutions in emerging
   economies.},

Title = {Exploring lifecycle energy and greenhouse gas emissions of a case study
   with ambitious energy compensation goals in a cooling-dominated climate},

Abstract = {Achieving low operational energy (OE) consumption in high heating and
   cooling situations typically leads to well-insulated buildings. In those
   cases, embodied energy (EE) can exceed the operational share. Specific
   literature refers mostly to heating-dominated residential buildings,
   with a clear focus on European, Asian, and North American countries.
   Information on embodied impacts of buildings other regions is virtually
   inexistent. This paper aims at estimating lifecycle energy and
   greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions of selected design versions of a
   photovoltaic-powered Living Lab in Campinas, Brazil; and at finding the
   embodied-to-operational impact ratios as well as the main contributors
   to those overall impacts. Homer Energy software supported sizing of
   photovoltaic (PV) arrays for ten energy compensation scenarios to, based
   on simulated OE, determine the feasibility threshold for onsite
   generation admitted by the building design. We then modelled lifecycle
   energy and GHG emissions for the net zero (NZE) and threshold energy
   positive (E+) versions of the case study design. The Cumulative Energy
   Demand (CED) and the CML 2001 v.2.05 methods supported embodied energy
   and global warming potential (GWP) calculations in SimaPro 7.3. The E+
   building compensates its OE plus non-renewable energy embodied in
   building products. Steel frame and partitions were the largest
   contributors to EEG in building products, whilst the insulated facade
   panels and PV array performed key energy performance roles at
   comparatively lower embodied impacts. Shifting from NZE towards E+
   status discretely increased the embodied-to-operational energy ratio
   (EE:OE), at similar embodied-to-operational GHG emissions (EG:OG)
   ratios. Pre-use share of lifecycle CED was slightly surpassed by the
   operational one, whilst responding for 60\% of lifecycle GWP. Material
   replacement over the reference service life contributed significantly to
   operational impacts. EOL treatment had negligible effect on lifecycle
   impacts. EE more than tripled OE and embodied emissions exceeded OG by a
   factor of seven. EEG prominence confirms the crucial need for a
   harmonized calculation approach, as experienced for operational stage
   accountancy over the recent years. We acknowledge the high uncertainties
   involved in using simulated over measured OE consumption and in using
   foreign LCI databases. The former limitation can be solved by monitoring
   operational performance upon projects completion. This study offers
   practical and detailed reference for LCA practitioners in all countries
   facing the latter challenge, which will persist until integrated
   national LCI databases finally become available. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.
